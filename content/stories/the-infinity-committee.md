UNIFIED TEMPORAL RESEARCH AND SECURITY SOCIETY

Admissions

Date: -- / -- / --

Congratulations! I am pleased to inform you of your admission to the Unified Temporal Research and Security Society, starting immediately. Your admission to the Society is likely evidence of our confidence in your potential, and/or recognition of your unique personal abilities. We believe you have much to contribute to the intellectual understanding of our craft and that you are a worthy representative of our diverse and brilliant membership.

Now, I imagine you’re probably wondering why you’ve received this acceptance letter, having never applied for such a position. You’re also probably wondering if time travel is real, or if this is just a silly joke. Believe me, I know how you feel. If you really do think this is a joke I invite you to stop reading immediately. Of course, I know you will keep reading. I know because, well, I am you.

Rather than attempt to explain myself any further, I will start by explaining a little about the Society. So, first principles. Time travel is real. You have no doubt noticed the stylish briefcase sitting on your coffee table; that is a time machine. Of course you’re familiar with time travel fiction, so you’ve likely begun to wonder what the rules of time travel really are. Has anyone tested the Grandfather Paradox, is it possible to travel forward in time, et cetera.

As it turns out, time travel is very difficult to understand. I would love to begin by telling you about the origin of the time machine on your table, but honestly I think that information has been permanently erased from the universe. What I do know is that, being a time traveler itself, the machine is atemporal. It is ageless and infinite. It existed in its current state at the birth of the universe and it will continue to exist in the exact same state for all eternity. It possesses the end result of infinite technological progress. It can send anything to any time or place instantly. It makes no noise and requires no power source. It is probably sentient, and probably smarter than you or I--or even the sum total of intelligence on the planet. There may or may not be multiple time machines, but given the nature of the device that is merely a semantic argument. One machine could easily loop around through time enough that every human being who ever existed could be in possession of it for his or her entire lifetime. Like I said; time travel is confusing.

As you have already postulated, the Society is also atemporal. We do not know how long our organization has existed (which, as you will come to understand, is an illogical question), nor do we know our organization’s purpose. It is equally impossible for us to count our members without a temporal reference frame. Perhaps everyone is, was, or will be a member of the Society. Perhaps you are the sole member. Again, this is a semantic argument. For reference, take note of your dialog with yourself in this letter. By joining the Society and becoming a time traveler, you too have lost your coupling with temporality.

Now, for the most important question. Can you affect a change in the past that alters the present?

The short answer is “Yes, but free will is a myth.” Many a budding time traveler has traveled back to the invention of the atomic bomb or to the French Revolution and learned that nearly all of the individuals present at these events were time travelers with varying agendas. The outcome of the event is directly caused by the time travelers who have arrived attempting to change it. History is full of these paradoxical time loops. We can only roughly estimate that they exist by counting the number of time travelers at a given time and location.

Branching alternate histories make for engaging science fiction; the reality is much more confusing. Using your time machine you may travel to any geometric location in spacetime. However anything you do in your past will, logically, have already happened. The only certainty is that you cannot break spacetime by causing a time paradox because time is categorically paradoxical. In fact, all of causality may be the result of layers of time loops and paradoxes.

I remember how you felt at this moment. You were confused but confident that re-reading this letter would help clarify the mess of paradoxes forming in your mind. Regrettably, it only gets worse.

As you’ve learned, time loops cause a loss of information. Once a loop starts it is impossible to tell what non-paradoxical actions may have originally caused it. The original reason you were accepted to the Society has been irreversibly erased from the universe. Perhaps when the time comes you’ll learn why you gave yourself a time machine.

One final note; don’t worry about writing a copy of this letter to send back to yourself. Just send this one back when you’re done reading. To be honest I don’t even know if I wrote this.

Sincerely, Yourself, at this moment.
