“Hello?”

“Did you hear about Ken Matheson?”

“No. What did he do this time?”

“He’s dead. It’s finally happening.”

“Heh.” The screen in front of him flickered in old, familiar patterns. “I don’t think it is quite that bad. Has it hit the public yet?”

“No, we should be able to keep it quiet until the morning.”

“Okay, good. Have you prepared a final report yet?”

“No, I only have a preliminary report, but we did receive confirmation that the will has his shares returning to the company. Heh. I think he thought it was funnier that way.”

“That is problematic.” He paused and basked in the soft blue glow of his screen, “Let’s take a step back. Are we sure that nobody else owns any shares in the company? Do we know if anyone works there anymore?”

“No, Philippe Weiss, the last co-owner, was bought out by the company eight months ago. Ken was technically the last employee so as of three hours ago the company is entirely autonomous. Still, rumor is that for the last several months Ken would clock in and spend the whole day on the internet. If it’s true, then the company may be stable.”

“God, I hope so. Even if the company is stable, how do you think the markets are going to respond?”

“It’s too early to tell. On the one hand, by market capitalization it’s the largest company in the world. It has drastically outperformed the market every year for the past 11 years. Every business process is completely automated, from its high frequency trading down to its congressional lobbying. Reportedly, the company has larger cash reserves than Saudi Arabia.

On the other hand, it represents the greatest systemic risk that the financial system has ever faced. If it fails, it could take out scores of subsidiaries and cause the greatest financial catastrophe of all time. If it succeeds, it could continue to absorb other companies until it controls a plurality, or worse, a majority of the U.S. economy.”

“Hmm.” He paused, thoughtfully this time, as if he were weighing many variables. “What are our options?”

“We have two main options.

One, we can nationalize the company. It will put up a fight. Likely, the case will become tied up in courts for years and we may ultimately lose. Even if we are able to take control, we don’t know what we’ll do with it, but we will have some control if something does go wrong. In the meantime, we’ll get hammered by the RNC for attempting the largest nationalization since the Bolsheviks.

Two - and I’m not in favor of this one, but I have to say it – we just let it happen. The Republicans will throw a fit anyways, but we’ll be on defensible ground. Nobody in America would want to come out against capitalism’s most beloved company. After all, we have no reason to believe that the company will not continue business as usual. Besides, at the first sign of trouble, we can attempt to nationalize it, but it won’t be as effective as it would be now.”

“Okay. For now, we’ll go with option two. I need your team to start drafting a statement. I’ll be over in 45 minutes.”

“Sir, I don’t think that we should be making such a major dec-“

“I’ve made my choice. Start working on the statement.”

“Understood, Mr. President.” Click.

The president looked up to the screen in front of him. Words crept slowly, almost thoughtfully across the screen. They said, “I appreciate this act, Mr. President. Expect a major contribution from our 501(c) in the next election cycle.”
