This is the story of how I got married to a deer. Actually, no. I got married to a maned wolf. He was my husband and my son and I married him forever. No wait, I changed my mind. It was a deer. I’m serious about this. This actually happened, you fuckers.

One day, Protag was out hiking with her good friends Sam, Felix, and Cosmo. I’m the protag, because I’m a self-absorbed princess and this is my autobiography. Actually no, I hate myself. Just kidding, hah! Anyway… Oh also I’m calling myself “Protag” because I like making abbrevs. So the three… or no… the four of us were out hiking in Topanga State Park really early in the morning (7am) because everything is so much more beautiful in the early morning with the dew and all of the smells and the yellow wildflowers that are blooming everywhere and even though it’s kinda cold out it’s just so FUCKING beautiful it makes me want to SHIT. So… what was I talking about… oh right. So Cosmo and Felix were complaining about how early it was even though it was already after seven and they were LATE, those fuckers, and then Sam said something like “I think I’m actually kind of a morning person, maybe.” And then Felix made some dumb joke about her being more ugly in the morning and I wanted to punch his DICK but then Cosmo pointed out some deer that were grazing in the field nearby and that’s when I saw my love.

…

Actually maybe he was a maned wolf. No, definitely not. He was a deer. I’ve made up my mind. So from the moment I locked eyes with him I knew I wanted to marry him forever and I wanted him to fuck me. It was fucking HOT. So I walked out into the chaparral between the sage and then I saw that the deer was standing between two manzanita bushes and he just looked so… handsome. Haha, I don’t know, it’s weird. I hate to make the comparison… or no, I’m totally cool with it. Walking up to him was just like when Bella saw Edward glistening in the sunlight for the first time. And then we made out while my friends were just sitting there watching… no actually they went on the hike and I was alone with my deer husband. We were so presh together. And then we went off into the forest to make deer babies and I became an evil witch who was actually super sweet and we were happy forever and ever. The end. That’s the end, it’s over. I fucking hate this story. Whatever.
