“You can’t be serious.”

“What… why not?”

“We can’t have the phrase ‘Final Solution’ in our company tagline.”

“But it’s a perfect way to represent the store. It’s all you’ll ever need!”

“We’re a family friendly grocery store! We don’t support Nazis!”

“What … I don’t understand where you’re getting Nazis from this. It’s just a bunch of kids running through a grocery store and being silly.”

“Okay. Are you fucking with me? Do you actually not see it? Jesus… just replay it and I’ll tell you which parts we can’t have, which, by the way, is all of them.”

“Alright. And again, don’t feel bad about giving me honest feedback. I can take it.”

“Okay… here. Pause it. Look at that! Why does it keep cutting back to that low shot of the blonde-haired blue-eyed kid that makes him look like he’s presiding over everything?”

“Woah dude, that’s really reading into this a lot. This is a multi-ethnicity scene, every child is represented equally here.”

“So… play it again… Yeah pause again. Why is the Jewish kid standing at the cash register? This is so racist.”

“We can cut that scene if it’s offensive.”

“Wha… It’s not just that scene! Look, keep playing it. You transitioned from that to this bit with the watermelons… are you *fucking serious*? We can’t show *any *of this to our shareholders. Not a single frame.”

“But surely you don’t think the ending is racist? They’re all running in a circle together. They’re all friends!”

“They’re not running in a circle. They’re running in a swastika. You ended your commercial by fading to a red screen with a swastika made of children.”

“Okay, I guess that’s actually a little unfortunate but I think I have an idea for some quick reshooting that can totally fix this.”

“Please tell me your exact plan.”

“Okay, so I’m thinking we can avoid the racism issue altogether by just having the kids wear costumes or something. Ghosts? How about ghost costumes?”
