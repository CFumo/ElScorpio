“You’re starting the story off all wrong.”

“Excuse me?”

“Wrong. Incorrect. Fantastic failure to communicate. It’s disturbing."

“But I haven’t even written anything yet."

“Yes, but now you have. Four lines of ghastly dialogue. Now five."

“Who the hell are you?"

“Owen Willittend.” He flashed a disarming grin and shoved his business card in my face:

Owen Willittend

Director of Operations, Critiques Division

“I’m your inner critic."

I looked him up and down. My inner critic made an impressive figure. I caught myself admiring the evenness of his stubble, the angelic slope of his nose, the way his Adam’s apple bobbed.

“So, what are you doing here?"

“Astute question. I’m here to give your story a pulse. Starting with this dialogue."

“What’s wrong with the dialogue?"

“It’s flat as hell, Cameron. And besides, there’s no context. We could be talking to each other in a cramped, sweaty Port-A-Potty in the middle of the Mojave desert for all your readers know. There’s no setting."

He had a point.

“Of course I have a point! Now quit with the dialogue and get to some of that juicy narrative you’re always sprinkling with flowery words to remind your reader just how smart you are."

I blinked a couple times, then looked around. Thankfully, we were not in a Port-A-Potty in the Mojave. We were in a restaurant. Tables stretched out for miles, and waitstaff shuffling through the maze with glasses and trays. I saw the table set between Owen and myself - sterilized white plates, salt and pepper shakers that served more as pieces of modern art than anything else, and silver forks and knives that caught the dancing candlelight.

“Nice, Cameron... but weak. That’s only what is seen. Remember all those little tips you read about description? You need to use all your senses! Okay, we’re in a restaurant. What about the muffled conversation? The clink of glasses or the shattering of ceramic on marble? What about the savory scent of filet mignon wafting through the air?"

“I don’t really think that’s important for this story. Besides, it’s a short story, so every word is sacred. I don’t have time to ramble on about ambience. Doesn’t move the plot."

“Plot!? What do you know about plot?” Owen gripped his fork and knife and stabbed the sky. “Let’s be clear, Cameron, you rely on gimmicks, wordsmithing and cleverness to buoy your writing. Plot is not your strong suit. Neither is character-building. That’s why I’m here."

“Do you always have to be so antagonistic? I thought this was going along pretty well so far."

“I’m your inner critic, Cameron! I’m not paid to be nice. Your intentions aren’t so rosy either...”

He leaned over the table and started rubbing his thumb back and forth across the blade of the knife.

“See, normally I'd feel honored that you’d summon me as a character into your story... except for this little voice inside my head telling me that the real reason you're including me at all is in some vain attempt to extricate me once and for all - by making me tangible, malleable."

His pale green eyes bore a hole through my forehead. The waiter stopped by. Owen sent him away with a wave of his hand without breaking his glare.

"I didn't know consciences could have consciences. In any case, I'm not so naive as to think I can get rid of you."

"Good. Now there's some sense." He nodded in affirmation. “You need me. I make you better."

"I actually do believe that much," I spouted. "But you can be a overbearing. I want to work out a truce: How about you rain on my parade all you want - stomp on the bandstand, rip a hole in the drumskins, strangle the conductor - but only after I've written them into being. Not before or during."

“So you want me to give you a chance to fall on your face and make an ignoble display of your writing skills for all to see before I tell you the perfect way to go about writing what you are aiming at?"

“Yes."

"You'll be humiliated. In fact this whole sequence is a bit humiliating. People don't really talk like this. Your dialogue is hardly believable. And now I'm drawing attention to it so as not to patronize your poor readers."

"Don't like the dialogue? Ok, monologue it is. Or better yet, narrative."

I could tell I ruffled his feathers a bit. He flashed those eyes of green venom at me. He opened his mouth to protest but all that came out was the adorable mew of a kitten. His face flushed crimson.

He started speaking in the third person. “Owen knows what’s really going on here. Hey— cut it out, I don’t speak in the third person.” Owen continued to speak in the third person. “Owen does not approve of this. Cut. It. Out. Listen to Owen - to me - I’m going to make you better."

I had him where I wanted him; time for the final blow. I reached into my pocket and pulled something out with my right hand. Owen’s eyes followed my hand and peeled open in terror. His face collapsed into a mush of quivering cheeks and beads of sweat.

“Alright! Truce! TRUCE!!"

“The pen is mightier!” I yelled. I took the fountain pen in my hand and edited my inner critic out of existence. No blood. No screams. Just an empty void where Owen once sat.

A hush fell over the restaurant.

I gathered my belongings and made my way through the tables to the exit door. I pushed it open. Outside was an oven. I cupped my hand to my forehead to block the sun and turned around. There, behind me, stood a lonesome Port-A-Potty. And everywhere else: sand and joshua trees as far as the eyes could see.
