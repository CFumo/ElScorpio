Dr. Sigmund Freud sat lackadaisically at his desk, nursing a cup of coffee and staring out his office window at the park across the street. Warbling bird songs filled the cool morning air and the city of Vienna went quietly about its business. By all appearances the summer of 1938 would be even more beautiful than the year before.

As he gazed at the park Dr. Freud noticed the spark of an idea forming in his head. This was no ordinary idea; it was an epiphany. Though it was little more than an outline, it clearly had the potential to revolutionize the world of psychology. He hastily tabled his coffee cup and flipped his notepad to an empty page. He needed to write everything down immediately, before it could flit away back into his preconsciousness.

No sooner had pen touched notepad than Cosmo opened the door to Freud’s office and walked in, looking vaguely concerned. Freud looked up in horror as his idea began to slip away. The trespasser spoke.

“Hey, what’s up dude? Err… Dr. Freud? I’m Cosmo, the author.”

Freud wracked his brain to hold on to the idea. He tried to address the intruder at the same time and only managed a mostly garbled sentence.

“Whatle your doing in my hou… office?”

“Oh well I came in here looking for… uhh… help figuring out what a Freudian Strip might be. You know, like a Freudian Sl… err… I guess maybe you wouldn’t know what those are but… well I guess I can just *make *you know what I’m talking about.”

Cosmo waved his arms around.

“There, now you know.”

The idea, the beautiful revolutionary world changing idea, was gone. And in its place was a new idea; “Freudian Strip”. A worthless idea. Nothing more than a meaningless pun. Freud glared at Cosmo, who ignored him and continued:

“So I’m doing this writing game with some friends where we exchange story prompts anonymously and then we write stories based on those prompts. And my prompt is just those two words. So obviously I need some inspiration, which is why I’m here Dr. Freud.”

Freud wondered if he was dreaming. Perhaps this Cosmo character was a representation of Freud’s own repression of childhood ideas? Maybe it was an embodiment of his repressed sexual feelings for his mother?

“Also,” said Cosmo, “I don’t know too much about the real Dr. Freud, which is why you’re sort of… simple. I just need some quick ideas, give me whatever you’ve got.”

Freud felt a sudden inexplicable urge to play along.

“Perhaps a Freudian Strip is the result of the subject’s repressed or preconscious feelings of intimacy toward another-”

“Uh… Dr. Freud? I think you’re going too deep. We just need a stupid joke that lasts long enough to barely count as a story. I kind of feel like I should be responding to the notactually-a-story-prompt with not-actually-a-story, y’know?”

“Hmm, yes. I see.”

Dr. Freud ran his fingers through his beard and stared out at the park, thinking deeply. After a few seconds he looked back at Cosmo.

“I have an idea, Mr. Cosmo. Why don’t we try acting out a Freudian Strip and see where that gets us?”

Cosmo’s eyes widened and he smiled wryly. “That’s a *good *idea. Let’s do it. Who should be the stripper?”

“Maybe… both of us? At the same time? If we are truly in a story, as you claim, then it would seem only logical for us to try to provide the maximum entertainment value for our rea-”

Cosmo’s pants fell to the floor.

“Oops,” he said in a forceful tone, looking seductively at the doctor.

Dr. Freud caught on fast. He pretended to yawn and tore off his dress shirt with a grunt, sending buttons flying around the room and exposing his hairy barrel chest. He was in peak physical condition.

Cosmo reached over his shoulder in a pose that resembled an underwear model.

“I just need to scratch my back for a sec- oops!” His hand came back, pulling his shirt off with it.

“Let me just grab my wallet,” said Dr. Freud. He reached deep into both of his pockets and pushed his pants down to the floor.

“My bad,” he said, staring into Cosmo’s eyes.

They were now only wearing underwear, standing face to face and staring into each other’s eyes. Dr. Freud knelt down.

“Oh, I need to grab onto something to help me stand up,” he said, still staring into Cosmo’s eyes. He grabbed Cosmo’s boxers by the elastic and pulled them down.

“Oh no, it didn’t work.”

Cosmo put his hands on Dr. Freud’s head.

“Here, let me help pull you up.”

Dr. Freud opened his mouth.
