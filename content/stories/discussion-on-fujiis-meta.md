Rachel:	If	Amanda	actually	writes	robot-threesome	erotica	I	will	FLIP.

Cosmo:	Is	she	really	going	to	write	it?

Rachel:	She's	trying	to	convince	me	to	make	the	February	issue	erotica-themed	for	Valentine's	Day.	It's	a	tempting	idea,	but	I	don't	want	to	make	anyone	too	uncomfortable.	Plus	at	that	point	I	might	feel	obligated	to	finally	publish	"Engorged	Rapist."

Cosmo:	You	should.

Rachel:	Wait—hahaha	no	you're	not	supposed	to	encourage	me!	I'm	not	ready	to	rehash	that	argument	yet…

Cosmo:	I	don't	think	you	need	to	worry,	I	don't	think	people	will	buy	into	it.	No	one	was	that	enthusiastic	about	the	Christmas	issue.

Rachel:	Yeah,	but	you	rose	to	the	challenge	like	a	champ.	You	know	what	that	means	about	the	erotica	issue…

Cosmo:	What?	Wait…

Rachel:	No	you've	totally	got	this,	"Eschaton"	was	basically	erotica,	just	make	it	scifi	again.	There	hasn't	been	nearly	enough	alien	sex	yet.	Write	the	sexy	version	of	your	first	contact	story	from	last	issue.

Cosmo:	Oh	jeez…

Rachel:	At	this	point	I	don't	know	if	we'll	ever	see	"A	Knight	to	Forget	Pt.	2,"	so	I	might	have	to	take	that	one	on	myself…	I	also	wanna	write	an	erotic	fanfic	of	Cameron's	vampire	story.	I'll	call	it	"Fifty	Shades	of	Will	Ferrell's	Creamy	Thighs."

Cosmo:	Hahaha	ok	but,	you	should	also	write	one	for	"God	Rest	Ye	Merry	Gentlemen."	You	can	make	it	a	Christmarotic.

Rachel: Holy shit. You naughty boy, that's a brilliant idea.
