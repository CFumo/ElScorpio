He flung the encrusted cumrag. Dozens of tabs closed with the rapid-fire click of a mouse. The house creaked. Afterglow kept embarrassment of the preceding seven minutes to a healthy minimum. Bomb attack kills at least 19 somewhere. America goes nuts over politics again. Britain pretends it's not going nuts over politics again. Science marches on, finding a new type of comet this time. The house creaked again. The frost this clear Saturday eve wouldn't get in, but it tried. The room cooled enough for him to consider a blanket. Alarms howled in the distance. Eerie sounding. He briefly considered the reason for the alarms. Broken horn on some ship or something. Why the fuck are ship horns so weird?

Heavy footsteps of his neighbor running down the shared staircase grew. He banged on the door angrily. Our cool friend froze, pretending to be sleeping, or not there. Whichever would fool the idiot. The neighbour's yells were muffled by the decently thick door. He would certainly not break through that. He didn't even try. His heavy footsteps descended in a hurry. His exclaims could be barely heard as he crashed into the outer door. The door slammed behind him.

The house creaked. The chill was getting to our friend. He draped a blanket over himself and continued reading people's opinions on a video he watched earlier. Each opinion confirmed his reasons for disliking the video and everyone's opinions on it. He wrote his own expletiveladen opinion. He contemplated playing a video game when the sudden urge to shit hit. He grabbed his phone.

He scrolled through a dozen six second videos. Some he played again and again, to which he laughed heartily while he shat. Annoyed, he considered the reason for the alarms. The local news site had no insight. Maybe someone in town had written a brief note on it. He began reading some of the notes, in a random fashion. The notes all had the same irritating whiny tone. What a stupid generation. He tried finding nearby notes related to alarms.

"the alarms are so loud at the shelter. love n peace"

"fucikng alarms at fuking 3? smh some ppl got work. fuck"

"Why must my annihilation be preceded by these creepy alarms?"

"WOKE UP TO ALARMS TV SAYS ITS THE END OF THE WORLD WHAT"

"lol slept through nuclear alarms. oops guess im dead"

"spooky alarms O_O"

"#Gemini are the type to set multiple alarms for the morning."

"so glad they have alarms for nukes. I'd be like 'wow what was that' lol"

His heart sank, made its way through his bowels and splashed into the toilet. Wiping once, quick as he could, he pulled up his pants and ran to the window. On the street outside traffic lay stuck, thick with pedestrians. In the sky above lay neat lines of nuclear missiles in reentry. The house creaked. "This is fucking stupid," were his last words.
