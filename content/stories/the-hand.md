Second	sight	ran	in	Ana's	family,	and	her	Aunt	Marina	made	her	money	as	a	medium.	Marina	was	always	warning	her	about	the	dangers	of	communication,	and	bragging	about	her	"many	enemies,"	which	were	always	"trying	to	get	at	her."

"You	must	not	do	a	ritual	without	the	proper	protection."	The	proper	protection	was	usually	a	circle	of	salt	or	thread	close	around	oneself.	Ana	was	setting	one	up	right	now.	She	was	going	to	do	a	ritual.

She	was	sitting	inside	a	long	length	of	red	ribbon	into	which	she	had	tied	six	knots.	The	seventh	knot	she	would	tie	from	inside	the	circle,	closing	herself	off	from	evil	forces.	This	was	very	important.

She	lit	her	beeswax	candle	and	turned	her	radio	to	a	station	that	was	only	static.	She	hesitated	briefly,	then	placed	the	radio	inside	the	circle	with	her.	It	popped	and	crackled	in	bursts.	Sometimes	the	buzzing	would	grow	louder	and	louder,	building	into	a	crescendo	of	weird	noise	before	abruptly	dropping	back	into	a	low	hiss.	Ana	began	to	have	a	vision.	She	was	standing	in	an	amorphous	space,	looking	back	at	a	humanoid	figure.	The	figure	was	covered	in	cracked	brown	bark,	and	in	place	of	a	face	was	a	tangle	of	long	roots.	At	first	Ana	was	frightened,	thinking	again	of	her	aunt's	cautioning	words.	A	potential	enemy?	But	she	felt	that	the	figure	meant	her	no	harm.	It	drew	closer,	smelling	of	mold	and	dark	places,	and	grasped	her	upper	arm	gently	with	its	claw	hand.

The	vision	faded	slowly,	leaving	Ana	groggy	and	dim.	She	saw	that	the	final	knot	in	the	ribbon	was	untied,	and	the	circle	was	no	longer	closer.	Or	had	she	forgotten	to	tie	it	in	the	first	place?	She	couldn't	remember.	Troubled,	she	crawled	into	bed,	still	feeling	the	ghost	of	the	figure's	touch	on	her	arm.

In	the	morning	she	could	still	feel	its	grip	very	clearly	on	her	upper	arm.	When	she	looked	in	the	mirror	she	was	alone,	her	arm	bare	and	unmarred,	but	she	could	still	feel	the	cold chafe	of	the	bark	and	the	soft	bite	of	its	nails.	She	clawed	and	worried	at	her	arm	but	she	couldn't	dislodge	the	spectral	hand.

She	was	just	starting	to	panic	as	she	drove	to	her	aunt's	apartment.	Marina	yelled	over	the	intercom,	"I	told	you	to	be	careful,	Ana!"	then	buzzed	her	in.

Marina's	tone	was	gentler	at	the	door.	She	beckoned	Ana	inside.	"Don't	worry,	love.	These	kinds	of	things	happen	sometimes	but	they're	often	harmless.	Let's	see	if	we	can't	fix	you	up,	eh?"

As	soon	as	Ana	crossed	the	threshold,	the	figure	from	her	vision	flickered	into	being	beside	her.	It	loosened	its	grip	on	her	arm	and	stepped	forward.	It	was	one	of	her	aunt's	enemies.
