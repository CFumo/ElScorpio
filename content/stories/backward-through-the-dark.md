The being called ●●● had grieved for a long time. It had lost its treasured companion over eight million years ago and still felt beyond recovery. Every evening it peered into the stars with its Infinite Vision, looking for some way to end the pain. One night it found what it was looking for.

\*\*\*

Laura Ramirez was watching television when something big crashed through her living room ceiling. Standing in the rubble was a man-shaped figure of shimmering light. It spoke to her slowly as she cowered against the far wall.

"My name is Red Circle Red Circle Red Circle. I have travelled very long and far from another world, though my civilization won't exist until far in the future. You see, by travelling at the speed of light, I was able to move backward in time as I moved laterally through space.

"Long ago I experienced the death of a treasured companion. It was 809,867,136 of your Earth years ago, from my perspective. Relative to you, this event won't happen for another 466,800,094 Earth years. Every night I used my Infinite Vision to scour the skies for a way to bring my companion back, until one night I saw you in your dwelling.

"I saw that .0000035% of the iron in your body was forged in the same star as .0000081% of the iron in the body of my companion, which is an unusually high factor of stellar-genetic similarity. I knew that if I brought you back to my planet, I could use your body to revive my companion. I also knew that it had taken 31,583,475 years for the light reflected from your planet to reach me—or, 638,333,615 Earth years—and by my time the atoms that make up your body had long since scattered to the cosmos.

"So by special transvection I traveled toward your planet at a rate of negative one times the normal speed of time. I had to make myself much smaller, and opaque to your visible spectrum of light, so you could see and comprehend me. I also had to learn to make sounds and human speech so you could understand me. We have to leave quickly, before any more of the atoms in your body are displaced. I will leave you time to write one note for your loved ones."

Laura tried to flee but was unsuccessful. ●●● took her to the laboratory of Dr. Patricia Smith, where it delivered much of the same speech. It also said this:

"I can't carry anything with me when I fly, and current Earth technologies cannot carry her body unaltered to its destination. I need you to create a Planck Skip with your special machines to send us to my planet the instant after I will leave."

"That is purely theoretical," said Dr. Smith.

"It will work," said ●●●.

"But it will fundamentally alter the structure of the universe!" said Dr. Smith. "All humans feel an oceanic sense of connectedness with the rest of the universe, though most of us don't realize we're feeling it. After the Planck Skip, we'll never feel that way again, and we won't remember that we ever had."

"Time is short, Dr. Smith," said ●●●. "We must use your machines."

Dr. Smith tried to resist but was unable. Through a trick of physics, Laura and ●●● consciously experienced all 638 million years of the journey together, though for their bodies the journey was instantaneous. When they arrived, ●●● was hesitant to proceed.

"You can have another hour, if you want," it said.

"I'm ready now," said Laura. She felt she had lived long enough, and she was uncomfortable being back in her body. Had she always felt so empty and alone?

\*\*\*

The being called ■●■ slowly opened its eyes. First one, then another, then another, until its entire gaze was focused on ●●●.

"I have been dead," it said.

"But now you're alive," said ●●●. "Thanks to a very dear creature from another world. Let me tell you all about her."
