Fleeting. Weighty pull. Consortium of Terror. These are the deeds of the wicked in our past. When magic befalls us, we are left in the streets. Aristocracy of wizards descends upon our government. We conspire. Eighty years of torment. Flames lick the floating cities. The preparation is complete and our executions are guaranteed. We accept our inevitable failure because others will know of us. Know that we fight for ALL of us.

Taking grav lifts, we ascend to their pristine islands. Removing the science defying sources of lift, we run off. Curious that after the visit from magic, we did not reverse engineer the order behind this new force. No magic is explained by reason and logic

Explosions. A holocaust offered to the gods of justice. We lay the bodies before them in quiet respect. This is no excuse. We transcend law and ethics for the greater good.

Sacrifice others and sacrifice ourselves for what is best.
