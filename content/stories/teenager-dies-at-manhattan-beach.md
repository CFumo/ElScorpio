Tragedy struck the community of El Segundo last night as Thomas Shelton died from unknown circumstances at Manhattan Beach at sundown.

The police report indicates that Thomas and three of his friends went to the beach at noon. After several hours spent in the surf, the group of teens proceeded to play in the sand near the water.

Eyewitnesses said that they heard Thomas scream shortly before dusk. Said Ellen Browning, a regular beachgoer, “I saw the boy dug into the sand. I didn’t see his legs or anything. [He] kept yelling and yelling and then he says that he feels that his legs are growing all over [sic].”

Paramedics were called to the scene by one of Thomas’ friends.

“He was bleeding by the time we got there,” said Jurgis Kruss. “His friends tried to dig him out. There were all these things coming out of him. Almost like limbs… melded into his skin and stuff. I guess they tried to cut some of those things off. He was bleeding badly.”

No official statements have been made by Torrance Memorial Urgent Care or LAPD.

*Jurgis continued, “It was fucking insane. It looked like goddamn roots. He was growing flesh roots. There were bones in some of them. Jon [Stanson, Paramedic] hooked the kid up with some Entonox while I tried to cut the protrusions, man. Even with a high dose the kid felt a lot of pain. It was a fucking mess. He went into shock in my arms. By the time we could move him, he was way too far gone. We got him into the merc and hauled ass to the closest urgent care. Drove when I heard Jon make the call. The kid didn’t have a chance. Couldn’t help him with clotters or anything. Worst part is, I went back to the site of the incident immediately. The cops were already there. Said they didn’t see shit. I went back to the bloody hole and yeah, man. The flesh was gone. No way someone took it- there was way too much attention there. I think it crawled away. It grew from the dead kid and crawled away. I’ve seen some fucked up shit, but nothing like this.”*

Ed: Stan. You gotta get rid of this part. Not only is it unsubstantiated, there’s no way we can run this. Let the Inquirer terrify the populace.
