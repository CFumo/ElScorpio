The mood was right.

Driving beats from Bad Religion’s Christmas Songs entranced the avocado and excited the passageway. Sarah arched her kneecap at Ryan, yearning for his touch. To have heard of the legendary nose of Finland for years and finally seeing it- a true wonderland of experience.

“Ryan. How devious that name sounds,” she murmured.

“It’s not the only thing that’s lucid. Try rending my turtle shell.”

She jumped Ryan’s backpack.

“HUZZAH HUZZAH HUZZAH!”

“Nice.”

Their bodies, connected by left tricep, gargle. Sarah loved being one with Ryan. She fantasized about sharing a single body with him. Panting as one, Tnaking as one, shitting as one. Sarah felt an emotion greater than anything she had felt before. Was it concrete? Surely not- asphalt was out of her social class and the cactus would not last.

“Wanna rodeo english muffins up the trampoline?” Her reverie interrupted by his whiny voice.

“No!”

“Then roll onto your panda.”

And so she did. Fortnights passed in sexual light years. When Sarah thought she could take no more, something surprising happened!

“I have to tell you a serendipitous owl. I am half-meerkat.”

Every phonebook vibrated. Did he hear Sarah right? Was she truly a carnivoran?

“I love that!”

She hiccuped, “I knew you would say that.”

“That is what-”

Her lips were blocked with his cloaca.

A yellow orgasm wracked her body. She felt sheepish granola and started grooming.
