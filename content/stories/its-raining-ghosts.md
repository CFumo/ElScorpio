Dear Nobody,

I guess I’m leaving this here for posterity. My name is Bharata Jagannatha. I’m going to kill myself today, but I think I’m one of the last people on Earth capable of writing so I figured I’d share what I know. Maybe it will serve as a warning to some alien species or … something.

Three months ago (March 23rd, 2078) a meteor hit Uganda. It obliterated a UNESCO World Heritage site so it was all over the news. It was a big irradiated environmental disaster that ended up killing a lot of people and creating a bunch of refugees. About a week later the cleanup crews finally found the meteorite and discovered that it was not a rock at all but some kind of spacecraft. It was obviously alien too; there was no doubt. Just looking at the thing was a mindfuck. Of course the media completely forgot about all the refugees and started endlessly replaying footage of the object. Nobody complained either; it was really hard to look away from the thing.

A big multinational team of scientists and linguists was assembled to try to prove the origin of the craft and maybe learn something from it. I think a lot of people were hoping that we would discover some awesome new technology. The initial report to the media was that it appeared to be an alien version of the stuff we put on the Voyager probes; a message in a bottle designed to preserve the knowledge and culture of some alien civilization. It was also old as shit. Hundreds of thousands of years. Whatever that civilization had been they were probably long dead.

Okay, so obviously something bad happened. Shortly after that initial report the media just kinda stopped covering the crash site. After two weeks of crazy news about first contact and aliens and shit, suddenly there was nothing. Everything was back to normal, except it all felt really stilted and fake. Nobody knew what was going on and people were really nervous about government conspiracies and stuff. I pulled some strings with my old military friends and managed to figure out that the media was trying to prevent the spread of information from the probe thing. It was like an information quarantine. I guess the research team had figured out how to translate the messages on the probe and whatever ...idea… they learned was spreading like some kind of disease. A few days after hearing this idea people would become catatonic. They’d stop in their tracks; stop responding to outside stimuli. They just froze in place until they died. It was apparently so profound that once someone heard it they felt compelled to talk about it, even if they knew it was a death sentence. They would call all of their friends and family and paint it on walls and sing about it for as much as a week and then … stop and wait to die.

I’ve spent the last month and a half inside a panic room by myself, and I’m fucking tired of it. I’m going outside, even though it certainly means that I will come in contact with the idea and end up killing myself. I just can’t stand this room any longer.

Wish me luck,

-Bharata
