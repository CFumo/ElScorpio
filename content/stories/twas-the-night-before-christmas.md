Santa was off, Christmas was under way, and Clementine was just sweeping up the last corner of Workshop 17 when Snowball came in through the back door. Clementine always volunteered for cleanup detail so he would be the last one left in the building. In general he enjoyed dorming with the other elves, but it was hard to get a little privacy sometimes.

He hid a grin as Snowball crept up behind him. Something crisp and green brushed against his cheek.

"Mistletoe!" he cried, his face lighting with delight, and he turned and kissed Snowball with a loud smack.

"Whoa whoa!" said Snowball, dropping the mistletoe as they fell to the floor together. He put an arm around Clementine's waist. "Jeez Clem, how much eggnog have you had?"

Clementine grinned. "None you jerk, I'm just excited about Christmas!"

"Really?" said Snowball. "I always feel a little sad once Santa leaves. We work so hard and there's so much activity for months and then one night it's just… done." He stared wistfully at the toy-making equipment that filled the workshop.

Sad on Christmas! Clementine couldn't allow that. He gave Snowball a big kiss right on the lips, pulling off his pointy bell-tipped hat and shoving his hand down the front of his pants. Together they kissed and touched in the low light of the empty workshop, surrounded by surplus toys and the happy echoes of their production. Snowball produced a large red-andwhite striped candy cane from his bag, and with a wicked glint in his eye, ran it suggestively over his tongue. Blushing as red as Santa's suit, Clementine allowed Snowball to pleasure him with it at length.

Later Clementine lay happily in Snowball's arms, both of them propped up against a big teddy bear.

"We better head back soon," said Clementine. "We don't wanna sleep through Christmas morning!"

"Yeah, you're probably right," said Snowball. His hand tightened very slightly on Clementine's shoulder, and his expression turned serious. "Hey Clem?"

"Yeah?"

"In the morning… don't walk to the mess hall alone, alright?"

"Why not?"

"I just have a weird feeling about tomorrow… It's probably nothing."

They kissed goodbye and parted at the workshop door. As Clementine walked back to his dorm, he thought about Snowball's mysterious warning. But that was nonsense. Tomorrow was Christmas! What could possibly go wrong?
