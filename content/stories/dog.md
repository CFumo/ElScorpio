Dog is stuck in a small, boring place. Lots of other dogs. So many! He doesn't like other dogs. They are mean and big. Dog bites dog. Men come in to break it up. Take the other dog away. Bye. What is this place? Dog is cold and lonely. And: hungry. Arararrrr… When is his girl going to get him? Should never have gone around the big door outside. Stupid! His girl was calling! But the outside! Dog ran until a car attacked him. He liked cars before, but… maybe not anymore. Then the men came. Where is his girl? He makes the lonely sound. Other dogs are barking. Dog barks too. Araroooo! Walks around. No room in here. People come in. Not his people. Another dog gets to go. Dog hates other dogs. He makes the lonely sound again. Little dog sniffs his tail. Grrrr… More people come in. Dog ignores them. But they're calling him. His girl! They open the door. Dog jumps into girl's arms.
