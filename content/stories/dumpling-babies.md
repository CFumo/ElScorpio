There was a

lady and she was sad

to be awake and every

morning felt

like it was her

last. She dreamt

of the time when

her children were

still alive but the

sweet tiny little

ones got sick and

died. They were

still inside and the

lady felt so still

and cold.

Doctors came and

went and

the lady felt scared

and very cold

so very

cold. She felt so

full and was so hollow

a wind could

blow her away.
