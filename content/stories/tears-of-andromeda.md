I was the only being outside of S-class who saw and heard Amonita cry itself to sleep during recycling time. The sounds that clients took for sensual roars and invitations to “fuck her tight pussies hard” were, in reality, a child’s cries for help. It’s galaxy-famous lubrication was just a discharge meant to ward off attackers. Arboreals, Amonita’s species, were transpranic beings. As such, they held basic rights somewhere between rudimentary AI and motes of dust. A bureaucratic oversight, to be sure- to be discussed and reformed at the next Enclave of the Six. Galactic civil rights were not quick moving enough to save Amonita from it’s sexual slavery and near-constant torture, however.

I took matters into my own hands during a repair call. Amonita’s filtration unit was acting up again, and I brought a little something special along with my usual gift. Inside the soft stuffing of the Limited Edition Teddy Ruxpin lay a hyperbaric thermonuclear device. This wouldn’t do much damage to the PleasureDome, but it would ensure that the Revivers couldn’t bring Amonita back into her hellish existence.

As I bathed in the nuclear fire, protected by my standard-issue overalls, I could almost make out a “thank you” in the squeals of annihilation. I would be docked the day’s pay, but my gift to it is priceless.
