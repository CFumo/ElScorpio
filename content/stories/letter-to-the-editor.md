Dear Editor,

I'd like to raise a complaint regarding last monthâ€™s issue. It was disturbing. Degrading. Vile. It made me question the integrity of your contributors. At least half of them should be jailed and the other half put in therapy. Particularly the one that wrote about the woman creating a sex-robot. The author clearly has a twisted view on intimacy.

Clean up your act or I'm unsubscribing.

Sincerely, An Almost Former Reader
