George sat at his desk in docking station four of the Mojave Space Port, wondering what his husband was planning to cook for dinner that night. His husband, Zedgoz, had told him to expect a "special surprise" when he got home. George assumed it was food. As interstellar traffic increased, he'd taken on more responsibilities at work, and he'd been pretty stressed. Zedgoz always pampered him a little when he got like this, for which he was grateful. Their relationship had gotten off to a pretty messy start—was it a whole year ago now?—but they'd hit it off after that. And when Zegdoz proposed six months in, George was bemused to hear himself saying yes.

When George got home that night, he found the front door unlocked, and all the lights off inside. Weird. He heard low speech from the bedroom. He walked in and flipped the lights on.

"Zed, what— What…"

"Greeting, husband!" Zegdoz was standing over the bed, claws clasped expectantly, beaming at George. *On *the bed was another offworlder, of a species George didn't recognize. They were soft, voluptuous, with a single gleaming eye and a huge crocodile mouth.

"Are you ready for your surprise?" asked Zegdoz, approaching eagerly and ushering George forward.

"My *what*?"

"You've been so accommodating since we began our relationship, but I thought you might be missing the company of females." He gestured toward the alien on the bed, then stagewhispered, "She's from the Antares system."

"Heya tiger," she purred, in a deep, gravelly voice.

"But she…"

"I know," said Zedgoz. "She's not human. But! You mentioned last week that you'd like to experiment a little in bed, so I thought this might be the perfect opportunity!"

"But I didn't mean…"

"No George, don't be embarrassed. I know how hard you've been working lately, and you deserve to blow off some steam. And besides, just *look *at her." He gestured again toward the Antarian. "Isn't she a marvel?"

George looked. Her scales shimmered faintly under the ceiling fan lights, and as he watched, different parts of her body began to expand and change shape. A long grey tentacle began to unfurl itself from her side. George swallowed.

"So, husband," said Zedgoz. "Would you like to start off on top, on the bottom, or inside?"

George turned toward his husband with a wide-eyed look. Zedgoz threaded his claws through George's fingers and squeeze them reassuringly. After a moment, George squeezed back.

"Inside…" he said uncertainly. If he was going in he was going in big.

"Splendid!" said Zedgoz. "You stay here. I'll go get the can opener and the photo album."

Zedgoz rushed from the room, and George looked back at the Antarian. She shrugged and grinned, and another long tentacle snaked out from beneath her.
