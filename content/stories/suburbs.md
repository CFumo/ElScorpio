*It was unbearable. I'd never felt so helpless. So awe-strikingly terrified.*

"You're home early. I didn't think you'd beat me back." my wife remarked as she walked into the living room. She fiddled with her keys and placed her purse on the sofa.

*This is wrong.*

I watched myself undo my tie and drop it on the table.  "I thought I'd surprise you!" I said as she walked over and planted a kiss on my cheek.

*No.*

"Well, if I knew, I would've started dinner sooner!" she cooed, heading to the kitchen. I saw myself eyeing her while she walked. It was a look of hunger, the look of a predator.

*Why is this happening?!  Why can't I stop it?!*

"Babe... I've got another surprise for you.." I said, releasing the top buttons of my shirt. I could hear her step slowly and hesitantly back into the living room.

*Please, no!*

I could see myself take a breath and look her directly in the eyes. "I was thinking... I'm ready... Let's start a family."

She let out a soft gasp before stopping herself.  "...You really mean it?" I watched a smile spread on my face as I nodded my head and opened my arms for a hug. My heart was in my throat. I was powerless to stop the scene unfolding before me.

My wife leapt to embrace him. The me in the living room held her tightly as his eyes peered over her shoulder, piercing through the crack in the closet door and directly into mine as I sat there, paralyzed and powerless. A sinister, inhuman grin cracked across his face. Fetid, black appendages stretched from his back, ready to grab their prey.
