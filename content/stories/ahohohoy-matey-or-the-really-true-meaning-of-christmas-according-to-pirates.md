There once was a little boy who lived on a pirate ship. At first, this might sound like every boy’s dream, but in truth he was very lonely for he was the only child on the ship. His parents had died and a kind but hardened old captain took him on as a powder monkey, since the last one was killed in battle; but also, because the boy played the flute so beautifully it could lift even the heaviest of moods during the longest of doldrums.

One night the co-opted sailing master (tied to the mast because he was prone to escape) gazed at the sky through his sextant and said, “Yes, by the looks of things, we are indeed still making good time and on course. And if any of you heathens care, tomorrow marks the birth of our dear Lord, Jesus Christ.”

“Jesus Christ?!,” said the boy.

“Watch your tongue!” said the sailing master, “I’ll not have you take the Lord’s name in vain even if no one else on this blasted vessel gives a damn.”

“Sorry, sir. I meant, well that is, you mean, tomorrow is Christmas?”

“Yes, dear boy. The stars never lie.”

“Then, that means this is Christmas Eve! The day Santa comes! Oh no, I’d better get to bed right away, he could be here any minute. Wait, I don’t even have a stocking to hang!”

And seeing the boy begin to fret, the old captain laughed and said, “Don’t ye worry yer pretty little head. That landlubber won’t be comin’ tonight. I can promise ye that.”

“He won’t? Why not?” said the boy.

“Well, fer one, we haven’t got a chimney now do we, lad? Harr har har.” laughed the pirate, cruelly.  “An’ even if he did come, there’d be nothing to do but hand out lumps of coal, what with all the pillagin’ an’ plunderin’ we do. If the good saint came to every pirate ship, well I suppose he’d be haulin’ so much coal there warnt be room for toys in his sack!”

And the kidnapped sailing master said with a grimace, “I’m afraid the old salty dog is quite right. Not even Saint Nicholas himself, kind as he is, would willingly step foot into such a wretched place.”

So the boy was heartbroken and, as he often does, sought solace in his flute. He played the saddest and yet most beautiful song. But as he played he noticed a strange sound coming from the distance. As it grew louder, he stopped playing so as to listen. It sounded like tinkling bells, but he knew it couldn’t be since they were forbidden out on the open seas as they tended to attract sirens. And yet he knew it was the unmistakable sound of…sleigh bells. No sooner had he recognized the sound than Santa appeared, barreling down the deck at such speeds that everyone on board scrambled to get out of the reindeer’s way.

Immediately, the boy leaped up and shouted, “Santa, you came!”

“Of course I did, dear boy! I can hear the sad song of a child from across the world!”

But the greedy pirates, seeing the lustrous velvet sack Santa was holding, descended upon him and wrenched it from his hands, tearing it open in anticipation of the booty that was surely inside. Helpless, the boy watched as the men loosed such goodies as pistols, fine rum, and sketches of women in their knickers. Wrought with despair the boy began to cry, but Santa simply said, “Ho ho ho, do not cry, dear boy, for I have brought those gifts for them!” Then Santa pulled from inside his coat a small lime tree, which confused the men at first, but for which they would later be grateful.

Upon seeing genuine kindness such as they had never before experienced, the pirates were suddenly overcome with shame at their behavior. In Santa’s overwhelming display of generosity, they understood the meaning of Christmas. Christmas was not about receiving gifts, it was about *giving *gifts. *But more precisely, it was about using your moral superiority to **shame others into social debt via the act of gift giving! *In no time, the pirates had jumped into Santa’s sleigh and set off to subjugate and oppress the nearest coastal village. One-by-one they worked their way through each house, knocking at every door, whether grand or humble. When the ambushed occupants opened the door with a shriek, and sometimes a weapon, the pirates would simply hand them a gift. At this the resident would avert their gaze and look sheepishly down at their feet, embarrassed for they had not thought to get the pirates a gift. “Not to worry. Warmest tidings of the season all the same.” the pirate captain would say, as if to further highlight their peerless courtesy. They would then move on, knowing the person now felt obliged to pay a kindness towards the pirates at their next encounter. And so they continued until they had visited every house.

When back at the ship, a boisterous conviviality broke out amongst the now gleeful pirates, but the old captain saw that the boy was still sad. He again approached Santa, but this time more politely, and Santa nodded. The captain reached into the bag and pulled something out and presented it to the heartbroken child. The boy, upon seeing the gift, forgot all of his sorrows and threw his arms around the tiny puppy now licking his face. And everyone was happy.

With everything as it should be, the captain now turned back to Santa and said, “We don’t be takin’ kindly to stowaways on this ship, but I believe we can make an exception fer ye. Ye be welcome anytime, me hearty.” And with that, Santa let out a jolly laugh and climbed onto his sleigh. As his reindeer rushed into the night sky he bellowed, “Yo! Ho! Ho! Meeerrrry Christmas!”
