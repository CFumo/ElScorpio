Detective Morales's first case followed a priest-turned-psychopath in a small mountain town on the Canadian border. Locals reported that Father Karlslaus became embittered and dissatisfied with his faith following the deaths of his sister and nephew. Increasingly terse and secretive, Karlslaus held fewer services and let the church fall into disrepair.

The countless subsequent disappearances in the area would eventually all be linked back to the priest. Karlslaus started with simple abduction and murder, hiding the bodies in the nearby woods. He quickly escalated to rape, pedophilia, dismemberment, and ritualistic brutality involving fellow degenerates from the surrounding township. Apparently unsated, Karlslaus proceeded to invent new crimes of such a heinous and unspeakable nature that the townsfolk were whipped into a frenzy of hysteria which local law enforcement could not control.

Morales tracked Karlslaus to an abandoned refinery 40 miles north of I-90, where he'd fled with some of his deranged followers. "I'm doing this for you, you bastards!" he screamed from the back of the patrol car. "I will sin and sin and sin until the true god must reveal himself to stop me!" On the way to the station, Karlslaus overpowered the sheriff and deputy and escaped into the woods. He hasn't been seen since.
