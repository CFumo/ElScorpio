I found a new trail today, tucked behind my house in secret. The grass was lush and full of clovers and still damp from last night’s rain. Endless trees lined the edges of the path. In a decade, it will form a full canopy. I snaked my way up the base of the hill until I reached a barbed wire fence. It cut through the serene landscape. There was a gap under the fence large enough for me to crouch through. So I did. I wouldn’t usually sneak onto someone’s property but this felt special. I was surprised by how few creatures I saw. The birds were subdued and the squirrels complacent.

Half a mile in, I stumbled upon this gorgeous tree. If I knew anything about trees, I’d know what kind it was. I’ve seen them around before, but this one was magnificent. The limbs shot straight up then curved in a woven tangle. It’s home to dozens of birds, I’m sure of it. I stopped to relax in its cool shade and bumblebees buzzed around my head as they swarmed the golden poppies beside me. A light breeze rustled the canopy above and the branches dance back and forth, as if to greet me. I inhaled the mix of the fresh grass and bark and thought, I want to die here. To become one with the Earth again in the most wondrous of places, not taking my last breath in a cold, sterile hospital. So I’ve arranged for my things to be put in order, and tomorrow I will return.
