Surface into the primordial sky. Birthed as a phosphorescent calf into a void–the unseeing eyes desert-white and elongated. The final Holocaust broke the final seal. Glimmering, wet, wrathful. The big empty stirs and elucidates all matters. Everyone hears, but no one listens- the covenant is complete.

The image of death hangs in the collective mind’s eye. It is pulsating.

She quivers at the thought. Sweetness turns to ashes.

Crimson above all. Crimson below all.

The final seal is broken.

Ebb.

The Watchers converge. The Watchers bleed their congratulations.

Devouring themselves for the last eternity, they see.

A great symbol burns across the sky.

Breathe now. It is.

Void.

Secrets hidden in the language of humankind feed Her fires. All is ash in the crossing of the times. Backward and forward, it is meaningless. Pearlescent eyes extend with the agony of the cosmos. Tachyons shriek in all eight directions of time. Bells toll and the black crown manifests herself. Sixty-one legs burst from the flesh. A crescent moon weeps as does the sun. No more.

No more. She stands apart, the giantess. Sweeping away the sky, she bears her womb. Split open and pallid. We stand on the shore of her offal. We aim to please as the churning inside us continues. Endless universe wracked with the bitter cold of unmovement and woe is unleashed. A swarm of suns shatter at the sound of the birthing howls.

crass imagery on my canvas. revocation of a social contract.

perception marred by experience of holy enlightenment

carry on, carry on.

evil? there is none. only the empty.

i kneel at your feet

a swell within.

basilisk stare. i return.

untarnished by the majesty i worship. i slumber and await the stirs.
