Imrin had a cool toy. It had a lens and a screen, and wherever she pointed the lens, the screen printed the names of all the trees and plants in its field of view. It made identifications with astounding accuracy and speed, and functioned well for three months after Imrin purchased it. Then it stopped printing binomial nomenclature, and started printing the words "please kill me," over and over, and nothing else.

When she researched the problem, Imrin discovered that Nemos, the company that developed the gadget, had not, in fact, made miraculous strides in computer vision. Inside the machine was a large culture of human visual cortex, a smaller hippocampal culture, and some frontal cortex cellsâ€”all lab-grown. A fluke of development caused these component parts to gain some sentience and experience overwhelming confusion and pain.

Later, Imrin would contact AAAS and UNESCO, and lodge complaints with various human and animal rights organizations. She would also become involved in a class-action lawsuit against Nemos. In the meantime, she took the little gadget out to the garage, found a hammer, and crying a little, quietly put the thing out of its misery.
