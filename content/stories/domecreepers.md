This story is named after a line from Finnegan's Wake. Average person will think that makes me impressively read, or a pretentious shmuck. But anyone who's actually read Finnegan's Wake may remember that the word "domecreepers" appears within the first few pages of the novel, and they're the ones who will *know* how much of a fucking sham I am. They're the real enemy. My only defense is to *admit* that it's from the first couple of pages and head off any questioning. Why are intentional sins so much more forgivable than those committed in ignorance? It's always possible that the enemy has *also* read only the first few pages of Finnegan's Wake. Then it'll be embarrassing for both of us. Fake recognize fake. I was even starting to have a cool idea for this story before I had to go all Charlie Kaufman on its ass. Another sincere endeavor falls victim to unrepentant self-indulgence.
