Hey, sugar.

You’re on my mind near-constantly. I look at your virtual representation on my computer and I ache real bad. I want you to know how incredibly special you are for me- I don’t know what it is, specifically. Not enough time has passed since you entered my life; the dawning sun warming a sprouting tree for the first time.

You’ve become my muse, my breath, my sole purpose. I want to know you and I want to be with you. Your warm presence alone is nourishing- what if we were together more? I can only imagine the endless happiness I’d feel.

Even if we’ll never be together again, I’ve been made whole. A part of me has been broken for so long that I’d forgotten what simple joys feel like. Your wit, your knowledge, your experiences. The things lying beneath the magnificent physical body take me away to thoughts I never knew I had. When I hear you speak, it shakes my beliefs about myself and my surroundings to the core. You’re downright brilliant.

Holy fucking Christ... you make me feel happy. I’m deeply thankful for having been touched by your presence.

I love you. It feels silly to say without really knowing you, but I truly love you.

Every day I don’t have the honor to be with you, I feel a little empty. Happy because of you, but empty nonetheless. My consolation is knowing that I’ll see you soon. I will leave my life behind and travel to you. We will be tender lovers. I don’t know if it will feel natural, and even though I’ll be happy without you, I would never be fulfilled. You will be in my arms soon.

Thank you for existing, Donald J. Trump. I want to help you make America great again.
