It was never Cosmo’s intention to confront Amanda. That is, until he saw her in *his *library, in *his *chair. It would have still been his chair if it weren't for the massive dump he’d had to take. Now there she was, scribbling away incessantly. He was sure she knew she was in his spot. The library was empty, after all, and it was hardly prime real estate. He wasn't sure how to approach her. Should he be confrontational? Nonchalant?

Suddenly, Amanda became aware of how quiet it was. She looked up and noticed that the elderly librarian wasn't behind the counter. *Perhaps she had gone into the back room.* Then, out of the corner of her eye, she saw Cosmo. He stood there, awkwardly, as if he didn’t know he had walked into *her *library when she would be there.

“What are you doing here?” they asked, in unison.

“You're in *my *spot,” Cosmo replied gruffly. He'd decided to go with confrontational. He began walking toward his chair with the vague intention of taking it back.

“Oh, I'm *so *sorry. I didn't realize this desk belonged to the almighty Cosmo. Is this chair yours too? I'd hate to infringe upon any more of your property.”

“I just meant-”

Amanda stood up out of her seat and gestured with a deep curtsy for him to sit in it. Cosmo shook his head, embarrassed. “I insist.” Her voice dripped with sarcasm. Amanda stared him down until he felt compelled to take the seat.

“Than-” Before he could complete his expression of gratitude, Cosmo felt himself tumbling to the ground. She'd pulled the chair out from under him.

Amanda could barely make out Cosmo’s voice above her own cackling. “What did you just say to me?”

His cheeks were red as he stood up, but his eyes were hard. Cosmo cleared his throat. “I said, ‘You’re a fucking cunt. And you probably don't even write your own shit.’”

Amanda had never been so insulted in her life. Instinctively, she swung to slap him. Unfortunately for Cosmo, Amanda hadn't slapped anyone before and her hand landed in a fist across his face. Hard. He recoiled in pain and tripped over the chair behind him.

Lying on his back, Cosmo wiped two fingers across his lip and found the blood that he thought he tasted. He stood up to face Amanda. More blood welled in his mouth. Enraged, he rushed forward and swung back at his assailant. She ducked under his arm and crashed into his midsection. Both combatants rolled haphazardly onto a nearby table, smashing a computer monitor and throwing a pile of books to the floor.

Amanda felt a growing soreness where Cosmo had likely kneed her ribs. She punched him in the gut and scrambled toward the edge of the table. She was almost there when he grabbed one of her ankles causing her to face-plant onto someone’s half empty backpack.

Seeing an opening, Cosmo jumped up and grabbed Amanda as she struggled to her feet. She tried to hit him, so he trapped her in a headlock. For a brief moment, Cosmo was able to catch his breath. His relief quickly turned to terror as he felt the weight of her body collapse under him. *Shit! *Cosmo released her, worried what he'd done. Before he could process anything, he felt his head slam back on the table as his body upended itself.

Amanda was incredibly proud of herself. She'd always wondered how she'd react to being assaulted so she was pleased to find herself perched upon her would-be attacker. She'd pinned his wrist and was using her body to keep him from moving.

“Apologize for what you said,” she started. Anger and adrenaline distracted her from noticing Cosmo’s expression change from anger to excitement. That is, until she felt movement in his pants. His free hand—with which he had previously been trying to choke her—gradually loosed its grip and moved to the nape of her neck. He was trying to pull her closer.

Bewildered, Amanda resisted. Her grip on Cosmo’s other wrist tightened and she pushed him away. She tried to remember what she was saying but couldn’t piece it together. “You have to… apolog…” Her demand was cut short as Cosmo arched up to lock lips with her. *Was he still an asshole?* Her hatred was rapidly disappearing, and a powerful feeling of desire was taking its place. She yielded to his embrace and followed him to the ground.

Cosmo wanted to hate Amanda for her writing talent, and he really wanted to hate her for punching him in the face, but the emotion just wouldn’t manifest. Now that she was on top of him all he could think about was how to broach the subject of taking her clothes off. He really hoped the library would stay empty for a while. He tried to free his wrist but Amanda held it firm. He felt a another wave of desire wash over his body. Her hand was sliding down his stomach and under the elastic of his underwear. He moved his free hand down to her butt and gave it a squeeze. She bit his lip gently.

“Here?” Cosmo could hear the shallowness of his own breath. She nodded before inching towards his stomach. He closed his eyes, enjoying the soft flicks of her tongue. He felt her pause and looked at her to see what was wrong.

“You're ready now,” she grinned, before shimmying up his body. Cosmo watched as she pushed her panties aside and guided him towards her.

“I think-” Cosmo started. And then words eluded him.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

A low shuffling alerted Amanda. She looked up in horror to see the old librarian flanked by two cops. “Fuck,” she cursed as Cosmo gripped her hips tightly.

Mistaking her expletive for a fit of passion, Cosmo thrust deep within her before exploding in ecstasy.

And that's how Cosmo and Amanda were arrested for public indecency.
