A botanist watches bees pollinate a flower, a California Poppy or Eschscholzia californica to be precise.

His brow is glistening with the warmth of the late spring sun as, before his eyes, nature dances in organic rhythms.

The flower opens generously with fully mature petals splayed in invitation. A spray of orange stamen thrusts from its center, proudly erect, and just beneath lays a dusting of soft pollen.

One after another, bees come to rest upon this bright and beguiling host. Their feet find well worn grooves that guide them towards golden treasure. As they nestle close to the flowerâ€™s center, the hairs on their legs stiffen. Tiny sacs of pollen fall away from pockets in their feet and legs. A vibrating motion attracts new sacs to fill the pockets until they are heavy. An exchange is made, sumptuous and natural. The bees take turns, moving in and out at a steady pace, as the poppy breathes and sways.

The botanist dabs his brow, unable to avert his gaze.

It is very erotic.
