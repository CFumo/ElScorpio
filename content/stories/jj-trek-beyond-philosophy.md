A gorgeous shot of a really alien looking space ship is silhouetted against our sun or some other star. It's not important what star it is. Locations are not important.

"I AM A BAD MAN, HAHA HA!"

"PREPARE FOR ME, THE HERO WITH SLIGHT FATHER ISSUES!"

"HAHA, THE HERO, YOU CAN'T GET ME!"

The hero gets the bad guy with some beautifully shot help from his friends. One of them had a thrilling death.

Gorgeous, wow. And the action, thrilling.
