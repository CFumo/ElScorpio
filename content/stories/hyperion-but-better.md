Pain. Unimaginable pain coursed through Fedmahn Kassad’s back. The shimmering energy suit protected him from the deadly blow, but only partly. His body wanted desperately to rest- to sleep away the great agony. Instead, the soldier spun out of his supine position and leveled his rifle at-

-nothing. The great beast was no longer there. Where did it go? It could move at an incredible speed, but Kassad should have been able to see it on his HUD.

Suddenly, an echo:

“Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed”

It was back. Kassad looked frantically around. The dune he was in, with the half-covered entrance to a labyrinth was empty except for him. So where was this Shrek?

“She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb

In the shape of an L-”

Kassad let loose a volley of ballistic shrapnel into the mouth of the catacombs and the music stopped. Silence. Utter silence.

“You stepped into the wrong swamp, motherfucker,” Shrek growled, Scottishly.

Kassad had no chance. The great, lumbering ogre made short work of the trained soldier- the Butcher of Bressia. Shrek took the limp body and stuck him on his Tree of Onions.

The ogre let out a long, pained yowl, “Donkey!”

Life is like an onion.

Life is like an onion.

Life is like an onion.

Life is like an onion.

Life is like an onion.
