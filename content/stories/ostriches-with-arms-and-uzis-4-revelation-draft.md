EXT. FOREST - DUSK

EARNEST leans hard against a fallen tree, pushing his glasses up his beak. He is unfazed by the bullets passing overhead.

EARNEST (grimacing) It’s too bloody cold out here for this.

PANCHO Afraid your tailfeathers’ll freeze, Ernie

PANCHO leans out from behind the tree and [shoots the bad guys a lot with a big gun].

EARNEST It’s not my tailfeathers I’m worried about. And don’t call me Ernie.

MAJOR AKINDELE (chewing his cigar in his beak) Will you jackasses knock it off. We have to save the president’s daughter. [kinda lame, fix -C]

EARNEST walks out from behind cover- suit jacket blowing suavely in the wind. He takes aim at a long-haired foe and lands a wellplaced shot on the goon’s gun; pointing it in the direction of another metalhead. With a second shot EARNEST kills the first bad guy [meh -C], who then compulsively fires on his friend.

ZOOM INTO DYING METALHEAD #2

METALHEAD #2 (screaming, bleeding) My bleak existence is at its end. Take me down into the void, Father!

The last of the goons breaks into a sprint away from the battle. Muscles bulging in his arms, MAJOR AKINDELE lifts his huge machine gun and opens fire on the metalhead. [he dies]

MAJOR AKINDELE (smiling, chewing cigar) Tell Satan I’m coming for him next.

OSTRICHES begin reloading their weapons. [badass exposition of guns]

EARNEST Brilliant. So what’s our plan, Major?

MAJOR AKINDELE I ain’t got time for plans.

PANCHO (turning his fitted baseball cap backward) Chingada! This shit just got real.

MAJOR AKINDELE chambers a round in his M60 and flicks his cigar butt into the snow. It goes out with a wet sizzle.

EXT. SATANIC ALTAR - DUSK

Snow is falling softly on the scene. SATANISLAUS BLOODSLAYER is busy tying the President’s daughter HEATHER to a sacrificial altar. An explosion rocks the trees nearby as three goons are sent flying into the brush. [more epic gunfight]

METALHEAD The blood of dark gods flows through my veins, devils fly by my command.

PANCHO kicks the soldier hard enough to kill him.

PANCHO Whose head is in the sand now, bitch?

SATANISLAUS (growling) They found me! [says something really metal]

SATANISLAUS unties HEATHER at gunpoint and drags her to a waiting helicopter. The sound of the whirring helicopter blades drowns out everything but the gunfire.

HEATHER Major!

[He should say “God Damn Hoochie Mama!” here, but it sounds weird because it’s like he’s calling her that -R]

MAJOR AKINDELE runs to catch the helicopter. He jumps and grabs the landing skid of the helicopter with his arm just as the helicopter starts flying away.

AKINDELE and BLOODSLAYER fight on the helicopter, trade snappy one-liners

PANCHO and EARNEST get in the second helicopter and give chase Gatling gun sky battle over a volcano AKINDELE kills BLOODSLAYER, puts on the emergency wingsuit and flies HEATHER down the side of the volcano

They kiss as the volcano is erupting

More grenades, more ostrich references

Make it clearer that the bad guys are black metal guys

Where’s the corpse paint
