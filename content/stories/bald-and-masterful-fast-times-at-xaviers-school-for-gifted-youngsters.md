The long years as headmaster of The Charles Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters had made Professor X impervious to the bizarre. Or so he thought…

It was Spring Break. The last of the students had left a few days ago, leaving him alone at the academy. In a more pensive mood than usual, Professor X silently wheeled himself around the mahogany-lined halls. He was reflecting on the pedagogical necessity of blackboards when something caught his eye in Jean Gray’s room. With a slight sense of trepidation, he rolled back quietly and peered in.

The window was open. Shafts of light streamed in, bathing the room in a heavenly glow. The bed was cloudlike, the fluttering drapes ethereal.

All things considered, it was a rather ordinary scene at the school—or, at least it *would’ve *been ordinary if not for the impish man jiggling joyously about the room. Professor X watched, uncomprehending as the creature pranced his way toward Jean’s dresser and began rummaging around, tossing her unmentionables to the wind. Knickers were floating on the sweet spring breeze like cherry blossoms as Charles indignantly wheeled in.

“Oh”, the Professor mumbled, “My sensibilities!”

Professor X reached out, feeling for the creature’s presence. He found it instantly—a roiling ball of tension and desire.

Against his better judgement, Professor X picked through the contours of the being’s mind. His innermost private and sensual thoughts were Xavier’s to peruse like books in a great library.

Professor X understood that—to an unbelievably clichéd extent—anyone powerful enough to enter the school undetected generally intended to harm him and his pupils. In fact, that was so predictably the case it was nearly self-parody. The fact that this interloper didn’t appear to be malevolent was shocking. Yet the more Professor X probed the munchkin’s mind, the more certain he became of its intent.

This foray was less malicious and more… Pervy.

Charles was taken aback. But also, confusingly aroused.

The little man spun around, taking Professor X by surprise. “Yo-ho! Shiver me timbers and get me booty!” The cretin hollered, ”If ye can guess my name, ‘tis my duty: I’ll do wha’ever ye wish. Hoo hoo!”

Now Xavier was no skallywag—he’d studied his folklore and knew this was a textbook encounter with the roguish Rumpelstiltskin.

“Rumpelstiltskin” Xavier replied in a bald and masterful timbre.

The sad malformed being doubled over as if flogged as it croaked, “Arg matey, ye’r’ve guessed fine and true, now what is it ye’d have me do?”

Unsummoned memories—long forgotten—bubbled to the surface of Professor X’s mind. Back to the more scandalous days of his youth. Back to his time with Max Eisenhardt. Magneto… *Maxy-muffin*.

“Strip”, Xavier commanded. His tone was authoritative, but inside he was quivering like a newborn lamb. “And call me Master X.”

Rumplestiltskin rubbed his hands together and said, “Yarg, how cliche! But alas, I’ll do as ye say!”

The gelatinous creature’s hands trembled as they reached for the clasps of the burlap sarong that had hitherto been barely covering his disfigured flesh. It took a moment of nervous fiddling before the clasps released.

Master X, meanwhile, began to exercise his telekinetic powers. He levitated himself out of his wheelchair and shuffled clumsily toward Jean’s bed. He plucked the imp from his perch on the dresser, tossing him onto the bed. The creature’s dirty cloth waved behind him like the flag of some sexually depraved country, fully exposing his glorious, blubbery form for the first time. Master X used his formidable powers to stiffen himself in anticipation.

“Now, tell me I’m sexy!” Xavier demanded, his manhood pressing comfortably against the unshapely mound of Rumpelstiltskin’s chest.

“Yarr err..” The misshapen form stuttered.

“TELL ME!” Roared Xavier.

Rumpelstiltskin groaned his final groan, “Yarg, all fer one an’ one fer all! Are ye done yet, ye miserable cue-ball?” His shriveled testicles ached with overuse.

“I can still move my legs, can’t I?” Master X snapped back as his toes wriggled.

“Aye. Such strife…” Rumpelstiltskin gripped his spent cock and started licking his spend off from Master X’s lower back. “Me word is me life,” said the grimy imp.

Xavier grinned. “MY word is your life, Rumpel—”

“NAY!” Cried Rumpelstiltskin, becoming instantly erect. He knew what the miserable professor wanted and knew that he could deliver.

Plunging fast and hard into the old man’s ass was a blessing and curse for the imp. Raw energy traveled through his overworked member and up his spine. For a well-used ass, Xavier certainly had the anal grip of a younger man. Pain and pleasure melded as the culmination of the day’s triumphs and tribulations transformed into the frantic ferocity of the magic dwarf’s thrusts. The sickly sweet ass stink filled the room once more. Rumpelstiltskin’s fatty paunch slapped the thin ass with percussive force. The arrhythmic staccato set the perfect pace for the rising vocalizations of pleasure.

The moans turned to screams of passion. It took Rumpelstiltskin a minute to realize the unearthly sounds were coming from his own throat. The electricity in his sack was overwhelming. He knew he would soon blow his load.

Suddenly, fatty Rumpskin heard a crash and the breaking of glass from just outside the window—someone was nearby! Xavier began to bray like a sexed donkey, so Rumpelstiltskin covered the old man’s mouth with a pruney hand. Master X’s newly muffled cries were barely audible. Rumpelstiltskin slowed the pace of his pumping and came with a stalwart confidence.

As the santorum dribbled down Rumpelstiltskin's sack, the lovers saw Magneto’s perverted face in the window!

“Fuck off, sir. Ye mangy cur!” Screamed a red-faced Rumpelstiltskin.

“Yeah! Go suck Cable’s wang, loser!” Quipped the satisfied Xavier.

The dejected old man in the purple cloak stalked off and played pocket pool at the bus stop.
