Writing this in case anyone finds this. Don’t know how widespread the flooding is, but this could be important. Also, just writing about it makes me feel a little more focused; I’m feeling less shaken up.

Flood hit at 9:20 PM earlier today. I’d heard screaming coming from my window and took a look outside. I was on the computer writing right before. Was rainy and unusually dark, so I didn’t see anything unusual. Normally, screaming happens once in awhile, but the veracity of these was chilling enough for me to look. Now that I think of it, there was a train horn going off for an inordinately long time. Distracted me from a video I watched online. Maybe that immediately preceded the screams and flooding?

Anyway, I looked outside for a long while- probably about 15 minutes. During that, saw a few shadows (assume they were people) walking briskly away from the lake to the west. Saw a large amount of water in the streets- far too much to be from even a torrential rain. When I saw a trash bin floating by, I knew there was some water issue. What’s strange is that the people I saw didn’t seem to mind. That made me uneasy.

I got a little cold, so I turned around to get a blanket off my couch. Heard a really loud yell for help. It seriously fucked with me. I think it was a man. There was so much shrill distress in that voice, a spike of adrenaline shot straight through me. I had the impulse to hide from the window. I had an extremely strong sense that it was being watched. I took the blanket and sat wrapped up under the sill, listening hard. All I heard was the rain. That’s interesting, actually. Even then I hadn’t heard any traffic- a sound that normally fills the evening air. I’m guessing the streets were already inaccessible.

I crept my hand up to my desk to get my phone. No service, but I could tell the time- 9:43. I tried restarting my phone, hoping that the loss of service could be rectified, but that didn’t help. I didn’t want to get up to get this laptop yet. I still felt uneasy with the idea of being at the window. Not sure if it was some deep paranoia, or if there was actually something scanning the windows for movement. I walked on my hands and knees to

Oh god. Very scared. Heard gunshots (?) in my hallway followed by absolutely insane sounds. My hands are shaking I am so scared. I hear rhythmic thuds from the hallway walls. Sounds like a legion of bullfrogs and hyenas. I can’t describe it. Fleshy impacts and chittering. Typing on laptop near my washer and dryer. Only place to not see the windows and door besides the bathroom. I hear pained moaning, like someone is pleading down the hall. It’s 11:27.

Bones breaking. That’s what I heard. Like when I prepare a whole chicken and wrench out the legs and wings and break the large bones for broth. Sickeningly dry snaps, but much deeper. I can only imagine what bones make that… fuck, I’m scared. It’s right in front of my door. I hope I locked my door. Christ fuck I’m scared...
