Sipping his coffee and watching out the window, Hank was chatting with the engineer when a movement in the dark caught his eye. Two horsemen rode up beside the train.

“Looks like we’ve got trouble fellas,” said Hank.

“Shit,” said the engineer. “It’s the Rodriguez Boys.”

Hank jumped up and rushed to join him at the opposite window. A huge dark shape was gliding alongside the train. Though there was no moon to illuminate it, they recognized the creature from the outline of its wings, and the glow around its mouth like low-burning coals: a dragon.

“Shit,” Hank agreed, and he caught up his rifle from the corner.

Outside, Roberto Rodriguez fired a single shot: his signal to the dragon riders. Then he and his cronies rode up close to the last car and prepared to jump.

On the other side of the train, the dragon landed on top of the rear car with a great crash. It tore a hole in the roof with its thick, sharp claws, and Rodriguez’s men jumped down into the car, guns raised.

“You know the drill gringos,” said Rodriguez as he walked into the center of the car. “Put your valuables on the floor and my men will collect. Anyone gets brave, and Gusano gets you for supper.”

Hank and his engineer peered around the door. “This train ain’t stoppin’ for you or your damn dragon, Rodriguez! Let the passengers go and we can end this peacefully!”

Rodriguez put a bullet through the window next to Hank’s head. “Haha! You can come get them yourself pendejo!”

By that time the train was approaching the Herbert Mueller Tunnel. Spooked, the dragon scrambled through the opening in the roof, much to the surprise of the passengers. Two of Rodriguez’ men grabbed nearby hostages; it was unclear whether they were protection from Hank or from the beast behind them.

The car entered the tunnel, and the rattle of the undercarriage echoed sharply against the stone walls. Hank and the engineer exchanged a look and then charged into the next car, guns blazing.

After five days, they were still inside the tunnel.

“I don’t think we’re in Arizona anymore,” said Hank.

“Si hubiera sabido que este tren estaba poseído...” mumbled Rodriguez.

The dragon trumpeted weakly from the other car. Hank peaked in through the window. The lights in that car had been extinguished in the chaos of the dragon’s feeding.

They’d tried to stop the train at the end of the first day, but the door to the engine was inexplicably hot and wouldn’t open. None of the doors would open. In fact, it was unclear whether they were still in the tunnel at all. The blackness outside the windows seemed illimitable, and despite throwing several objects into the dark, and reaching out as far as they were able, they neither heard nor felt any evidence of the tunnel walls. A few hysterical passengers threw themselves from the windows, but their fates were not known. The psychological strain dampened remaining hostilities between the bandits and the crew.

“I don’t know how much longer Gusano is going to last,” said Rodriguez. “Maybe I should just go over there and put him out of his misery.”

“How long have you had him?” asked Hank.

Rodriguez struggled to light a cigarette. Hank leaned over and supplied his lighter. As the train rattled on into the darkness, Hank began to wonder if he would have to eat Rodriguez.
