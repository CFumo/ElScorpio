The Batclaw ripped into a black duffel bag and littered its contents--gold bars--all over the ground. The thug holding it was thrown violently backward. As the bars bounced and skittered around the grassy clearing Batman leapt at another thug with menacing vengeance. The poor man turned to counter Batman’s blow but was too slow; he was sent tumbling backward into the thick trunk of Major Oak and fell promptly on his face.

“Your pathetic goons-for-hire are wasting my time, Penguin!” growled Batman, using his retinal-implanted BatComputer interface to detect which remaining thug would be the most immediate threat. Just as two goons brought their machine guns to bear on him, Robinhood leapt from behind Major Oak and loosed two arrows simultaneously through the trigger guards of the thugs’ guns; jamming them. “Hahaha! Let that be a lesson to any man who dares bring his riches into Sherwood Forest,” laughed Robinhood. “My merry men and I will make short work of you and your stolen money.”

Batman sent a trio of Batarangs into three more thugs; all of whom doubled over in pain. “We’ll have to return this gold to its rightful owners in my timestream, Robinhood.”

Sensing someone behind him, Robinhood gracefully dodged under a thug’s sluggish right hook. “Do the people of your timestream really need that gold more than the poor villagers of Edwinstowe?” he asked, a little miffed. Sensing an opening, Penguin began to limp toward the edge of the forest.

Batman tossed a goon into a swath of Robinhood’s arrows and expertly caught up with Penguin; grabbing him by the shirt. “Well, that gold belongs to the Bank of Gotham and their loyal customers. If it isn’t returned many clients will lose faith in the bank.”

Unseen by the heroes, an injured thug began to crawl away from the clearing. “I think the correct action would be to abolish the banks and distribute wealth to each individual as needed,” said Robinhood. The injured thug crawled past Major Oak and broke into a dead sprint into the forest. “Furthermore,” Robinhood continued, “I believe we should abolish the State and set up a direct democracy. Common ownership of all means of production is the right way to do things.”

Penguin struggled against the Dark Knight’s iron grip, which had now begun to tighten ever so slightly. “I think people are entitled to the wealth that they earn, Robinhood. Assuming, of course, that they follow the rule of law and earn their money legally.”

“Yeah!” Penguin interjected, half listening and staring intently at two of his injured thugs who were beginning to stir.

“You know wealth inequality is the root cause of most social injustice, Batman,” exclaimed Robinhood, flabbergasted.

Batman’s grip on Penguin tightened even more. He took two steps closer to Robinhood and growled in the yeoman’s face. “Speaking of social injustice, I ought to bring you in for your crimes in this forest.”

The two stirring thugs began to stuff gold bars back into their duffel bag. Without looking, Robinhood loosed an arrow into one of the thugs; pinning his hand to his knee and sending him screaming to the floor. “Don’t pretend to know about what I’m doing here. I’m providing for those who can’t provide for themselves!” He yelled, over the screams of the downed thug.

The remaining thug managed to put most of the gold bars back into the duffel bag. He and Penguin briefly looked at each other. Penguin nodded solemnly.

“You’re just a childish anarchist terrorist with a 12th-century understanding of economics!” yelled Batman. “I wouldn’t be able to protect Gotham without having inherited my wealth from my DEAD parents!”

“My parents are dead too Batman! Because the king forced them into serfdom and refused to pay for their medical needs. Why don’t you invest your wealth into Gotham’s education system and a foster home system for troubled youth rather than parading around as a hypocritical vigilante!”

The remaining thug picked up the duffel bag and ran into an empty part of the clearing. Penguin threw him an oversized button with a green question mark on it. The goon pressed the button and--WHOOSH!--disappeared in a flash of green light.

“You’re just as much of a hypocrite, Robinhood,” yelled Batman, “For causing the wealthy to suffer instead of the poor! Also you’re such a wimpy bitch that you need a whole gang of merry men to protect you!”

“Why don’t you take off your fancy armor and fight me man-to-man and then we’ll see who is the bitch!” Robinhood countered.

Batman and Robinhood began to disrobe and prepare for a brawl. “You know there’s no way back to our time stream now, right?” muttered Penguin, with a look of resignation on his face. Batman--now completely unaware of Penguin--took a swing at Robinhood and missed the nimble hero by a mile. “We’re stuck in Sherwood Forest forever...” said Penguin, aimlessly wandering off.
