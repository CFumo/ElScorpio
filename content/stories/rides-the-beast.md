Occasionally Hana got some weird ideas. Two novels set her off: Jack Finney's Body Snatchers, and The Host by Stephanie Meyer. She became convinced that parasitic aliens were taking over her body, and tried to cut one out of the back of her neck. Her doctors told her it was a miracle she wasn't paralyzed, though she still had to undergo physical therapy while she recovered from the nerve damage.

More trying than the therapy was the struggle to adjust to her new psychic powers. She suspected the surgeons had reattached her nerves in such a way that they unknowingly unlocked her latent telepathic abilities.

"No offense," said her friend Ji, "but have you been taking your medication?"

"Look, just think about something and I'll tell you what you're thinking about. Pistachio ice cream. Your midterm on Thursday. Chocolate chip ice cream. The time you saw your parents…wearing animal costumes? And they were…holy shit."

"I never told anyone about that," said Ji, astounded. Hana swore her to secrecy, and tried to act normal for the next several months. Until one day she intercepted a Big Thought. She started sensing a huge, alien awareness, rapidly approaching from somewhere in space. Its mind was too different for Hana to really understand its thoughts, but she could not mistake its violent intent.

No one's gonna fucking believe me, she thought desperately, but she had to try to warn someone. No one believed her. Within the year, the Earth was unexpectedly and cataclysmically invaded.
