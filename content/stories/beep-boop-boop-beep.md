“Commander, commander, this is unit 4917. Abort the mission. I repeat, abort the mission. Trajectory landed on experiment 207. By my calculations, the launch was off by 0.0002 degrees. Our sensors indicate that the life forms on this planet have detected our entry and are closing in on our landing site. If they reach us, the experiment will fail. Prepare to restart 207.”

“Unit 4917 this is your commander. We have received your message and agree that experiment 207 must be restarted. Board your return flight. Do not attempt to salvage the crash site. We will begin restart activation immediately.”

It took Earth’s leading astronomers and linguists 162 years to decipher the messages transmitted the day of the infamous UFO landing. Coincidentally, just as the astronomers and linguists settled their dispute over where to publish their findings, the Earth boiled and all but a few single-celled organisms survived.
