Tohru Ichikawa's plan to build a giant pleasure mech had failed spectacularly. After a few half-hearted attempts at penetration, Tokumage—the giant sea dweller currently destroying Tokyo—had simply torn the mech to pieces before resuming his rampage. The pilot was recovered from the wreckage, and the on-site doctor determined that, though his injuries would heal, he would likely need to spend years in therapy. Ichikawa wasn't discouraged. He was used to being ridiculed, having spent years in exile from the scientific community after his disastrous "Human Eagle" project, and he stood by his theory that Tokumage's rampage was the result of misplaced sexual aggression, and could only be stopped by letting the monster vent his frustration.

Rear Admiral Kazuo Satou was not convinced, due both to personal intuitions about kaijuu habits, and to an intense dislike for Dr. Ichikawa. But the fact remained that Ichikawa was, somehow, the world's leading authority on kaijuu behavior, so Satou had no choice but to defer to him.

It was clear now that Tokumage would accept no substitutes—Ichikawa's next move was to acquire a female of the monsters' species. The ensuing search was a joint operation between the Japan Self-Defense Forces and the American Department of Defense, spearheaded by the celebrated kaijuu-hunter Malia Kealoa. After several tedious, expensive hours using Nemos Technology Corporation's Multistatic Sonar System, and Hawaii Pacific University's "Deep Throat" Downrigger Trolling Device, the team was able to lure a female to Onjuku Beach. As it was months from the creatures' normal breeding season, they had to prepare the female for the encounter by directly stimulating her genitals with a telescoping boom crane and a special vibrating device designed by Dr. Ichikawa. The construction workers on site found this task to be very distasteful, all except for on A. Moriyama, who was so aroused by the experience that he had to be forcibly escorted from the premises.

Once the female was sufficiently excited, they orchestrated an encounter with Tokumage. Tokumage sniffed her hindquarters once, then promptly returned his teeth and attention to the building he had been dismantling.

Rear Admiral Satou was livid. Millions of government dollars, hours with valuable surveillance equipment, a whole construction crew traumatized, all so "	

." Ichikawa was angry too—with himself. He should have realized by the coloration around the gills that Tokumage was a juvenile. All male juveniles of his species went through a period of exclusive homosexuality. Tokumage didn't need a female; he needed another male.

So the JMSDF and the USN went back out with the downrigger and trolled for a male. Another fourteen hours and they were back on the beach with a yowling kaijuu, Satou was completely incensed, and Ichikawa was hurriedly jury rigging another huge vibrating device.

When aroused, young males secreted a lubricant from their anus, the scent of which attracted other juvenile males. The telescoping crane was used again, this time to stimulate the creature's anus, a process made complicated by its occasional defecation.

This time Tokumage came running. With seismic force, Tokumage plunged into the other male's lubricated anus. Their copulation lasted for several hours and was televised nationally. Then the two creatures retreated gently into the sea. Dr. Ichikawa was awarded a national honor, and Rear Admiral Satou was forced to acknowledged that even insufferable nerds could be heroes.
