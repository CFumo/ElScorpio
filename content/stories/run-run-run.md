Give me a hit drop it drop it I know you’ve had more than your fill of alcohol you little piece of shit you cant manage a bag like that in your condition whatever that may be I haven’t been watching you all night so I don’t know what other garbage you’ve been stuffing into your broken beaten body yea I know what youre thinking how dare I say that about you get a good look at me yea get a good look you son of a bitch yea I may be on my last legs but boy I could tell you stories stories you wouldn’t even believe and im not playing you ive been around son you don’t get scars from playing life safe let me just tell you ive been torn and dirtied and broken in so many places you wont believe like the fire them damned kids almost killed me in that fire thinking theyre the shit burning a merch tent at the rage concert yea that’s right I’ve seen rage against the machine final show in fact and that’s not even anything I go way back I remember the first show I ever worked I couldn’t believe it was the kids the kids from New York who changed how music was and has been the velvet underground I worked the velvet undergrounds first LA show in 1968 and I tell you that was a rush ill never forget no one knew who they were no one but I knew you hear a lot of things about a lot of people and I was the most excited to see them the most excited to hear their music and man I was not wrong that night changed my life I loved it I loved my job even if I had to deal with shit I experience everything that night was the night a guy came in with heroin and I wasn’t going to try it I wasn’t you don’t believe me but I wasn’t and he and his girl were passing it back and forth and I got it you know I don’t know how secondhandedly is that what they say but the rest of the night I was making love to lou reed and his guitarrrun run run run run run take a drag or two then I was freshly cleaned like nothing had ever happened except this one scratch every night I got another and another scratch or bump or bruise a shoe mark or rusty hinges or vomit but the vomit wasn’t bad no because all that can get washed away and we can pretend that it was never there but everything ive seen has been accumulated only in memory albeit skewed memory cause the drugs and parts I don’t want to remember and parts I cant forget but I mean even the drugs get washed away everyone does it everyone knows everyone does it its okay cause in the end everything gets flushed out.
