It was Carlos's first time on the EIN-18 Trans-Net Space Station. It was Carlos's first time *anywhere *off Earth, let alone as far as the Kuiper belt. He'd joined the military late, after a long, unsuccessful attempt at a career in minor league baseball. Privately, he was sure he'd be useless as a soldier, but he needed the money, and probably the structured lifestyle, and the recruitment office was not picky.

Clutching the straps of his backpack, he wound his way through the bustle of the cavernous plaza, heading toward the bay of elevators that would carry him up to one of the anchored satellites orbiting the asteroid. As he caught the door to the elevator, he heard someone shout, "Commander Ghazali!" Carlos turned around and saw his old classmate Malik Ghazali standing only a few yards away. Unlike Carlos, Malik had entered the United States Marine Academy directly after high school, and his successful military career had turned him into something of a local hero. He looked exactly like he had the last time Carlos saw him, burnished and built, with an open, carefree face. Carlos had always admired him.

He realized Malik was standing next to another war hero, this one belonging to the Arphagians: Fleet Leader Tax 55511. Carlos was still getting used to seeing non-humans in person, and he was torn between admiration and mild revulsion. The Fleet-Leader's frame was distinctly inhuman, with limbs in the wrong places, and facial features that were difficult for him to process.

Carlos watched, starstruck, as a courier ran up to them and handed Malik a small package. After a brief exchange, the courier hurried off, and Malik and the Fleet-Leader turned back toward each other. The Fleet-Leader bent his head and touched several tentacles to Malik's mouth. Malik leaned into the touch, and gently squeezed one of the Fleet-Leaders limbs, before turning and hurrying toward the elevator bay. Carlos felt a shock of discomfort. Was it some kind of Arphagian thing? It couldn't have been a *kiss*—

Malik rushed into the elevator just before the doors slid shut, and the two men stood in silence as the car began its silent ascent. Again, Carlos felt that dissonant combination of admiration and uneasiness.

"Carlos? Carlos Calderon?"

"Hey Mal," said Carlos.

Malik clapped him on the shoulder. "Never thought I'd see you out here! Damn man, it's been... what. It's been forever!"

"Yeah, the recruitment propaganda finally got to me."

Malik snickered, and Carlos was pleased that he'd made him laugh. He felt a little more at ease.

"So how you been, Mal?"

"Oh you know, war's hell," said Malik flippantly, grinning.

"You and the Fleet-Leader looked, uh... close."

Malik gave an embarrassed laugh, and scratched the back of his head. "Yeah I guess we're kind of an item... Not technically fraternization, since we aren't part of the same military, y'know?"

Carlos looked away from Malik's bright smile, and shuffled his feet a little. "I, uh... I didn't know you were gay..."

Malik looked surprised, then a little sardonic. "Arphagians have three genders. 'He' is just a transliteration."

"Oh," said Carlos.

After a long, awkward silence, Malik sighed, then gave Carlos a small smile. "Y'know the farther you get from Earth, the less all that old shit starts to matter."

"Oh I know," said Carlos, looking away again. "It's just, y'know... I'm still getting used to being around all these aliens. Some of them look so weird, and I..."

He trailed off when Malik made a silent shushing gesture, his finger to his lips, grinning again. He looked pointedly at the ceiling of the elevator, and Carlos followed his gaze. Hovering in the corner was a tiny ball of glowing light, bobbing up and down slightly with the motion of the elevator. For a moment, Carlos didn't know what he was looking at. Then he realized it was an Anteriad, a sentient energy being from a planet in the Antlia Dwarf galaxy.

"Oh fuck. I'm sorry," said Carlos, addressing the ball of light. "I didn't mean— I didn't mean like, *weird *weird..."

The light began to bounce up and down with more vigor, pulsating rapidly.

"She says, uh... She says it's ok," said Malik.

"She didn't really say that, did she."

Malik grinned. "No."

The elevator slowed to a smooth stop, and vibrated slightly as it docked with one of the closer satellites.

"Well, this is my stop," said Malik. The doors slid open, and he stepped into the cold hallway of the satellite, with the Anteriad floating after him. Holding the door, Malik turned back and threw Carlos a roguish grin. "Welcome to space, private."

As he watched Malik stride down the hallway, Carlos was uncomfortably aware of how well the spandex spacesuit fit the man's sculpted buttocks. Welcome indeed.
