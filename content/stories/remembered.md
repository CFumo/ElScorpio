Dog on a rug with crackling snore. Dusty scent. Motes falling through stale air. Wallpaper faded and peeling in corners. Eyes closed, Mr. Randall rocks gently in his easy chair. Worn leather cradles his frail frame. Feet up. Reclined. He sleeps and dreams.

Young, sailing across the sky in a hippie van. Bright white and orange with the windows down. Mrs. Randall as he remembers her, 30, curly brown hair, back and forth between laughter and bubbling anxiety. They lean together, remarking on the neighborhoods below. So many pools. The van lands and they are ready to swim. He takes her hand. She leads them into a dive. Clothes disappear. Breasts just like he remembers. Her touch is less distinct, hard to place, but rich. The sex of his youth. Underwater. By the poolside. In the strange home that mimics and mirrors theirs. Conversation comes and goes. A blur.

Doorbell rings. Mr. Randall’s eyes flutter open. Dog hops up, barking at the front door as it swings open. Hey dad, I see you’ve been napping! -You caught me again. So glad you could make it, sweetheart.- Creaking up into standing. Unsteady, but for the cane. -You grew those tomatoes? They look delicious, sweetie. Here, let’s have a slice.- He waves his daughter into the kitchen where they talk, eat, play cards. Complaints about work. Gushing about her sister’s children. So big, so smart, so cute. Mr. Randall leans on the counter to listen. Tired. He takes a seat. Half a red tomato by the sink. Soft snore from the front room. Yellowed cards. A crease in the jack of clubs. Conversation comes and goes. Curly hair bouncing as she moves like her mother. Better than dreams.
