Space Marshal Livingston loved his swivel chair and cosmopolitans.

He sat in his chamber and stared down at the colony he had governed on Mars for the past five years. He was surprised at how adjusted he’d become to the spare landscape - the jagged mountains and cold, dry desert, The lack of green or blue. He’d grown to like it. He felt it represented the dire circumstances humanity faced back on Earth - and how they’d overcome them. How humanity had survived the Great Affliction. He heard a knock at the door.

“Enter.”

“Morning, sir.”

“What do you have for me, Keeblin?”:

“I came to inform you that Dr. Whitaker has been indisposed and his body is being taken to The Lab for storage.”

Livingston arched his index fingers on the bridge of his nose, and let out a heavy sigh.

“So it is done. He was the last of them. Maybe the best of them.”

A long pause.

“Sir?”

“Has his wife been informed?”

“Yes.”

“Good. I want a speech prepared before sundown. I’m going to go to The Quarantined with this news. We need to honor Dr. Whitaker’s memory.”

“Sir.” Keeblin bowed and exited the room. Livingston gazed on in silence, rapt in thought. He was staring at a frame on the wall. Behind the glass were two pieces of sun-stained parchment. Livingston didn’t need to read them - he’d memorized every letter by heart. But he read them anyway.

*March 15, 2217 *

*Former citizens of Earth, hereby named The Quarantined, sojourners to Mars: *

*The day has come. The day that our ancestors prophesied. The day that lived for so long as no more than an idle threat to frighten children into obedience. The day has come. Planet Earth is dying. Her resources are spent. The hands of humanity have overreached; the heels of humanity have overrun; and the ways of humanity have warped the natural order of things.  *

*In Her last attempt to spare herself, Earth has unleashed an unholy pox upon humanity unlike any ever recorded; a pandemic that has erased three-quarters of mankind and threatens to swallow the remainder if we do not make the necessary sacrifices.*

*You are the chosen few, those quarantined from the Great Affliction. By fate or fortune, you have been selected to bear the torch of the human race and keep its flame alit into the dark recesses of space - that it may never die out. You will be charged with forging a new existence for the species on Mars - learning from history and refusing to relive it.  *

*This is the final procession, a eulogy for humanity’s tenure on Earth; this evening shall bring the last sunset man will witness upon Her mountains and Her oceans. The last ship for Mars departs tonight, and with it, the hope of The Quarantined.  *

*The day has come.*

*General Superior H. W. Welsh III*

Space Marshal Livingston still got glassy-eyed remembering the General Superior. He was the only person that didn’t make it through the journey to Mars. Livingston wished he could still light Welsh’s cigars for him and hear the story about how he got his iron lung for the millionth time.

The marshal’s eyes now crept down to the second piece of paper, the one he was really interested in.

*Waiver of the Human Right to Life and Procreation *

*I hereby declare that I have been infected with erebus profundus, better known as E-Pro or The Great Affliction. I accept that by boarding this ship within the Mars fleet, I agree to have my life terminated within 2 weeks of my 30th birthday. I understand that this is necessary for the Good of Humanity. If I fail to comply with my scheduled termination, I permit the Human Welfare Agency (HWA) to seek and destroy my body to prevent the spread of The Great Affliction. *

*I also recognize the hereditary nature of E-Pro and hereby give up my right to reproduce. I understand that the HWA will exercise its right to abort any fetus carrying E-Pro. Furthermore, I accept that the HWA may destroy the parent infected with E-Pro as reproducing offspring with the disease poses a threat to the human race. *

*MY SIGNATURE AND DATE OF BIRTH BELOW CONFIRMS THAT I HAVE READ CAREFULLY THROUGH THIS CONSENT AND WAIVER FORM AND SIGNIFIES MY ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS.*

At the bottom was the collective chicken scratch of a dozen Nobel Laureates and certified geniuses. Livingston made out the nervous arcs of a specific name and a date of birth at the bottom:

*Graham Percival Whitaker, PhD. DOB: February 20, 2192*

“The very last,” Livingston muttered, unaware of his self-talk. He opened a drawer in the ancient desk with a tremendous squeak. He’d never done this before. He pulled out a packet. He pulled something out. He struck a match across the sole of his boot and lit the cigar now dangling from his lips. “The day has come.”
