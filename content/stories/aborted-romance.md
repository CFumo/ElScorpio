In another version of reality, Jr. Healey would grow up to marry Susan Hale, the girl next door. But his mother Trisha Healey hadn't wanted a baby, and had terminated the pregnancy. As in all cases of miscarriage and abortion, Jr.'s soul was dragged into Purgatory, where he was drafted into the ghost child army. There he was trained to deliver final retribution at the time of the Apocalypse. But he often fantasized about Susan, whom he was aware of due to his demi-omniscience. He romanticized their would-be relationship, thinking he could have made her happy if he'd been given the chance. She was probably married to some asshole now.

When the End Times were nigh, all the ghost soldiers ascended to the surface, and Jr. couldn't resist taking a peak inside Susan's house, where she was sitting with her husband and their three-year-old son. She looked beautiful, andâ€¦ she looked happy. That is, before they razed the house and killed everyone inside.
