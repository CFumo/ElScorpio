Twas the night before Christmas, and every good little boy and girl was tucked snuggly in bed, praying in whispers that the unstoppable demon would pass over their homes without feeling the urge to kill. Travelling through the night on his Reindeer Rotorvator—an enormous mechanical amalgamation of bone and metal, endlessly grinding and twisting into itself—Santa Claus combed the globe for his next victim, sniffing the air for the twin stenches of fear and sin, and carving a path of raw, torn earth and carnage as he went. Trembling under the covers, once you could hear the hideous metallic squealing and the jingle of bells outside your window, you knew it was too late.
