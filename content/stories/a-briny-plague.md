As I stepped off of our ship, I was greeted by a hail of sticks and rocks from the indigenous creatures. From Rogett's writings, I had surmised the Aen'nuk people to be peaceful, but Rogett also left out the briny plague I had spied across the expanse of this remote land. His illustrations of verdant savanna made no allusion to the overall pickled quality of the vegetation I was noticing before taking a chunk of granite to the eye. I lost consciousness, and regained it lying on the floor of a small, bare room with obsidian walls and a mirrored ceiling. I expected to find my body restrained in some way, but, curiously, not a single appendage was bound and I was free to walk about the room. Help. My reflection has left, but I have no way out. It visits me from time to time, aging where I have not aged, leaving my to wonder how my life has progressed without me.
