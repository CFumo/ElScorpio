I pull the car over the top of the hill and such a wondrous sight awaits me.  I can see the Disney Castle illuminated up ahead and I am driving towards it. The light blue and purple colors entice me into a deep trance.  A bump in the road brakes me free and I realize that I had driven away from the park earlier that night.  I become frantic, “No, no! I need to go home.  I’ve already left, how am I still here?” Confused, but no longer disoriented, I turn the car and head north, away from the castle and all its enchantments.  Through the darkness of the night, I drive over another hill, and I see it again, the Castle! It’s following me! I’m starting to panic and I do a complete U-turn to head the other way.  Then I notice a few more lights, faint at first, but then they get brighter and seem to creep toward me.  It’s Disneyland…I’m driving around Disneyland.

The fear is gripping me; I don’t think there’s any way out of this.  In my panic, I do the only thing I can, I start driving away from the direction of the lights.  The hairs on the back of my neck rise up and I can feel the goosebumps on my skin.  In the rearview mirror, I can see the lights closing the gap behind me.  I need to force all my energy ahead; I need to get out of this. I put my foot down on the accelerator and don’t lift it until the lights disappear.

*I’m out! *I think to myself, the blackness behind me is a comfort, I take a deep breath, *I’m on my way home.*

Suddenly, the road gets bumpier, I keep driving. *What? *I thought I saw traces of light in the road, panic, then brush it off…*wow now you’re seeing things, way to go, Crazy*.  I can’t shake it though; I know that they’re there.  The lights get more and more regular, and stronger with each tire rotation. It’s a track…I’m driving on a rollercoaster track.  My heart sinks into my stomach.  I’ll never get out of this place.

Darkness

Another theme park, a friend.  We’re walking to the car, keeping our distance in the darkness behind some dark and unstable characters.  I sit in the back; he’s driving and suddenly all the cars around us simultaneously come to a halt.  We’re trapped in gridlock.  “This is just part of the fun!” I say, knowing very well that the monsters in this world aren’t able to touch us.  ‘We’ll be safe’ I think to myself.

Like fog I can feel the various creatures creeping up on us, from all sides.  It’s as if I can feel them breathing, and the rotting stench of their decaying mouths is suffocating.  Still in the back seat, I cover my eyes, and hide my ears.  I’m ready. Preparing for them to bang on the glass, tap it even.  But nothing happens.  The silence is deafening.  After a while I find myself screaming, my friend seems to fade into the distance and I feel the smell still clinching my throat.  Still, the monsters don’t tap the windows, don’t rattle the doors, they’re taunting me, smiling.  The walls of the car cave in around me and I sense a flaky, rotting hand plunge down my throat.

Darkness

‘Again? I’m here again? No, open your eyes for real this time.  No more dreams!’ But my eyes won’t open and I find myself stuck in another nightmare.  I’m fighting with the people most important to me. Angered and upset, I’m running down a steep hill.  I can’t stop, the momentum is too strong, I’m no longer lifting my feet consciously it’s all I can do to not fall down.  Then the world becomes clear around me and again I feel trapped. The monsters, the Frankensteins, the Draculas, zombies and ghosts have multiplied.  This time they’re all carrying their own weapons.  They have rusted maces, chainsaws and morning stars, among so many others I can’t even name.  I look back, hoping someone will come to my aid but they don’t.  My tears fog my eyesight and I just keep running. Head on into this swarm of violent creatures for what feels like eternity.  I look back once more, again looking for anything familiar.  My foot hits a rock.  I roll down a few feet and hit my head.

Darkness.
