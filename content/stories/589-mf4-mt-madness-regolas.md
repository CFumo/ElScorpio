A lump of lard. A broken bone. The face skin of a maiden, freshly deflowered. These and many more went into the casket, built of ebony and frozen blood. The skeletal necromancer loomed over the collection of viscera and cursed tchotchkes. His glowing outstretched hands vibrated like branches in a gale. A darkness poured from the coffin with sickening weight. Curious vermin, caught within the black, experienced suffering beyond words.

The necromancer opened his mouth. Sharp teeth and forked tongue undulating in sync with the energies in his cavernous room. Pitch-black bile began to pour from his malicious maw. A low murmur rose from his chest, becoming a sickening gurgle as it mixed with the noxious bile. A frigid gust entered from the opening in the side of the room, carrying the spirits of countless heroes slain by the icy temperatures and sheer cliffs outside.

Atonal screams filled the necromancer’s abode as the spirits were forced into the cauldron of gore. As each spirit entered the tomb, the infrasound radiating from the towering death lord and the coffin changed pitch. The necromancer bellowed laughter and the whole mountain shook.  When the last of the spirits disappeared into the throbbing, bleeding mass, the necromancer drew forth a bone blade. Bending over, he held the wicked edge to his throat. He looked like a perverse butler, bending low to give respects to a master most powerful.

A quick slash. A torrent of putrid blood mixed with the pitch bile. The necromancer’s sacrifice bathed the ebony container’s ingredients. He shrieked with hatred and delight, jerking to the side. As he fell, the dark void evaporated. The quivering energies subsided. Only three sounds remained: faint breeze tinkling in from the vast hole in the wall, quiet gurgling from the fallen necromancer, and a faint stirring from within the coffin.

The vicious wound on the necromancer’s neck rapidly healed to an ugly, pustulous scar. After regaining some of his unholy strength, the dark wizard rose slowly toward the lip of the frozen coffin. He peered within. The tomb was no longer filled with fetishes of great power and putrid corpse parts. The sides of the dark wood and ice were smooth as glass, as if scoured and polished clean. At the center of the bath-sized coffin lay a lovely vixen, eyes locked onto him. These were no natural eyes- these smouldered with the flames of Hell itself.

“Hello, servant of the Dark,” she said in a guttural voice unfit to her irresistible body, “I am summoned for the pleasures of our flesh.”

“Of course.”

The woman rose. Sensual curves led the necromancer’s eyes to the tender regions of her body. Her unmarred skin glowing with a counterfeit purity.

Stepping out of the blasted coffin, she watched the necromancer rise. His haggard, lined face caressed her bare skin and firm flesh. He caught the scent of her sex, mixed with the unmistakable hint of brimstone.

The summoned creature spread her arms in display. She looked at him with unearthly longing. Enthralled by the angles of her face and the curves of her body, the necromancer embraced her. She looked so much like Cybill; it hurt the necromancer’s heart. His head reeled from the blood loss and excitement.

The embrace tightened, “I’ve missed you so much,” the death lord whispered.

“Of course, dark one.”

“I know that a bit of your soul is still in this husk.”

“Tread careful, ye servant of darkness. You know what you’ve brought from the plane of the damned,” the female facsimile uttered, the poisonous humor unmistakable in her voice.

“Please, Cybill,” he whispered frantically, “I’m sorry for it all. I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry. Please please forgive me.”

“Hahahahaha-”

“Please… I love you!”

The room thrummed to life once more. The summoned creature resembling the necromancer’s dead wife cackled- the sound ripped through the his ear drums and broke countless glass decanters in the room. A stone wall cracked from the auditory pressures.

Feeling the spark of love, the summoned creature bloated in the deep embrace- its skin ballooned and turned necrotic.

It screamed with giddiness. “You will never learn!” With a sickening sound, the creature’s body burst- a bleeding and pustulous cyst lanced with the betrayer emotion. The slick skeleton slipped out of the death lord’s grasp, exposed muscles pumping like hellish pistons. Three quick strides took the unholy automaton to the opening in the mountain room.

“No!” the necromancer’s despairing pleading couldn’t pierce the inhuman gales of laughter escaping the walking meat. The hellbeast turned to her summoner for the last time, gazed deeply into his eyes, and threw itself into the open air of the mountains. The unholy howls quickly receded and sharply cut off after a few agonizing seconds.

Silence.

The necromancer lowered his viscera-covered arms. He stared blankly at the trail of sloughedoff fat and blood leading to the window- that’ll require cleaning. He’d have to patch the long crack in the wall as well; it’s good to take care of problems before they get worse.

Sighing, Dewey Johnson, the Unholy Blackened Necromancer, Keeper of Mount Madness, walked to and booted up his computer. Launching Internet Explorer, he was greeted by the Casual Encounters page of Craigslist.

*Nothing Changes*, he thought and put up his usual post.
