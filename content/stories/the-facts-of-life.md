author’s note: For this story just imagine the Fact’s of Life theme song playing on repeat in the background for full effect but if you haven’t seen that sitcom or don’t remember the song maybe you can just look it up on youtube and i bet there’s a 10 hour loop of it just like everything else on youtube so just turn that on and it’ll give you the real experience of how this story is supposed to go down ok

“Son?”

“Yeah, dad?”

“Son, I think it’s about time I taught you about The Birds and The Bees.”

“Ok, dad.”

“Ok, son. You see, son. There are birds. And there are bees. And birds are, like. Y’see, son, birds, there are birds. And birds are these little motherfuckers. And they wake up real early and they’re always chirpin. Y’see, son, so those are birds, but there are also bees. And bees. Bees… I guess they wake up real early too. You don’t really see a lot of bees at night.  You just don’t, son. Bees are also up in the morning.  And bees. Bees buzz. They’re always buzzing around. Bees make honey. Do you think birds make honey, son?”

“No, dad.”

“That’s right, birds don’t make honey son.  Do you know why they don’t, son?”

“No, I don’t, dad.”

“Oh, well… I don’t really know either, son. I was kinda hoping you knew. Anyway, there are birds, and there are bees. And they’re very different. And if bees are making honey, what do you think birds are making, son?”

“Eggs?”

“That’s right, son. Eggs and FEATHERS! Don’t forget about the feathers, son!”

“Ok, dad.”

“Y’see, son, the birds need the feathers to FLY, son!  They need them to fly!  Do you think humans could fly if they had feathers, son?”

“No, dad.”

“Oh… Really?”

“Yeah. We learned that in science class.”

“Huh… Ok, well, good. I was testing you, son. And you passed.”

“Thank you, dad.”

“Ok, well, anyway. You’ve got birds and bees. Are you following so far, son?”

“Yes, dad.”

“Good, good… So, birds… and…. and bees… And then y’got spiders, but that’s a whole ‘nother story… Ok, well don’t get a girl pregnant and if you fuck another man you’ll get the AIDS and die, understand son?”

“Yes, dad.”

“That’s my boy!"
