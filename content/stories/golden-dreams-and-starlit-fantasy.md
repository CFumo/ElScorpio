Sugar Twinkle was a gentle unicorn with pink fur and a flowing white mane. It was dusk in the human world, and she would have to return home soon, but she thought she had time for one more good deed. She sniffed the air as she galloped through the soft evening light of the snowy forest. Shrinking down to the size of a bug, she found the entrance to a mouse's burrow and crept inside. Deep in the burrow, two mice were cuddled together to hibernate in their nest. An extra hole had been poked in one of the walls, and the draft made the mice shiver. Sugar Twinkle scraped some dirt together to plug the hole. Then she waved her horn and a little square handkerchief appeared, which she tucked over the mice. She left them warm and snug in the little nest.

Satisfied, she flew home on the evening breeze. The Land of Unicorns existed in a state of perpetual twilight. Stars peaked through the purple sky while the summer sun glowed low on the horizon, and the twin rainbow moons were visible at their zenith. Sugar Twinkle landed in the Enchanted Rose Garden, where she found her two friends, Symphony and Halo Star, whispering and giggling as they strolled together between the rows of sweet-smelling flowers.

"Hi Sugar Twinkle," said Halo Star. "Have you heard the news? The Summer Sun Festival is going to begin a whole week early this year!"

"I hadn't heard!" said Sugar Twinkle. She whinnied with excitement.

"Also," said Symphony in her soft voice, "Crystal Sunbeam is looking for you. I think she's still in the garden."

The unicorns parted ways, and Sugar Twinkle went to look for Crystal Sunbeam. She didn't mind the walk. The garden was lovely, overflowing with fragrant blossoms in a variety of colors. The chirp of crickets and the twinkle of the wind chimes played over the sound of the wind.

"There you are!" called Crystal Sunbeam. "You're back just in time! Your mate is about to foal!"

Sugar Twinkle neighed. She was going to be a mother! Followed closely by Crystal Sunbeam, she raced back to her stable where her mate, Immaculate Heart, was in labor. Immaculate Heart gave birth to two tiny, adorable baby unicorns. Their mothers named them Golden Dreams and Starlit Fantasy.
