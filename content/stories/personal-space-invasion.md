George manned docking station four of the Mojave Space Port. However, modern docking procedures were so thoroughly automated that he was little more than a glorified doorman. He was the sole occupant of the massive hangar, and the trading vessel from Arcturus was already three hours late. Bored, George jerked off to a Playboy magazine at his desk. He was so engrossed in his midday dalliance that he didn't notice the alarm signaling the approaching spaceship, or the whir and shudder of the docking vessel. One of the new arrivals stepped into his office at the exact moment of ejaculation.

"Greetings, Earthman!" said the alien.

"Oh my God!" said George.

"Oh my!" said the alien. "I heard that some earthlings excrete a white substance to feed their young. Could this beâ€¦milk? May I taste some?"

Before George could protest, the alien scooped a clawful of semen from the front of his pants and lapped it up with a scaly tongue.
