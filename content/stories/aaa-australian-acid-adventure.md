Imagine:

You walk through the NZ bush

Tired, in pain

Out of the shadows, your father's voice

"Alice Sparrow"

You point your light there

There is nothing

Only a tiny dingo

WITH YOUR FATHER'S HANDS AND FEET ("NOTHING. ...  ONLY A DINGO.")

The sun rises at that moment

Like fast-motion ("there is literally nothing there. just the dingo, which isn't a thing")

And there is a droning guitar riff in the background

No trees around Literally NOTHING AT ALL for miles and miles

Except for this dingo

And a gas station that you're right next to

And the gas station guy and his family

And you're all alone with this freak of nature, a beast-man

Father Dingo

"Alice Sparrow"

The baritone voice emanates from the animal

You awaken in a sleeping bag, realizing that there are 10 Cameron Sparrows all around you

They all have Dingoes in their arms

"Alice Sparrow"

They scream in unison, unleashing the snarling beasts onto you

A loud gong plays
