In a crumbling office building, a dark stairway led to an even darker lower level. There, several paces down a dingy hall, sat an unassuming door. Above it, hanging fluorescents flickered and buzzed like cheap neon dying in a liquor store window. The paint-chipped door was not labeled.

Miranda paused before it, staring at the knob. She chewed on her split ends and rocked on her heels. Her breath rattled. *It’ll be over soon. Like it never existed.* She had come this far but the sheer bleakness of the location was beyond her imaginings.  *Just knock and it’ll be over*. Her quaking fist hesitated in the air as she reached forward. *Just knock.* She made the barest of contact before the door swung open with a rush of stale air.

A soft-eyed gentleman stood in the doorway with a welcoming gesture. He sported a freshly pressed lab coat, a plain dress shirt, and khakis. His well-coifed hair gave him a distinctly scholarly look. “Dr. Aevum?” She trembled despite her relief at his professional attire.

He wore a warm expression. “Good afternoon, Ms. Jones. Come in, please.”

She nodded and crossed the threshold.

Inside the office appeared recently remodeled. Warm rich light emanated from a pair of patterned lamps. Plush couches faced each other on either side of a low mahogany table, framing a door on the opposite wall. Stacks of popular magazines and a water cooler indicated that this was a waiting room. Dr. Aevum motioned for her to sit.

“It’s lovely to meet you, Ms. Jones. Apologies if I surprised you. I saw you on the camera. I know that hallway can be a dreadful place to wait. Can I get you some water?” He was already filling a paper cup and placing it in front of her.

“Nice to meet you. Thanks,” she said and made herself smaller on the couch as he settled himself across from her.

“From our communications, I understand that you would like to have never existed. Were you able to get the details we would need to make that happen?”

With a quiet ascent, Miranda pulled a crumpled sheet of paper from her pocket and passed it across the table. The doctor smoothed it out and began to read aloud, “Fern Street, West End, Hartford, Connecticut. November 8th, 1982. Good, good. And it’s your father you’re intending to say hello to?”

“Yes. It’s about a month before I was conceived. He was working on this street as a paralegal. He said he always got lunch by himself somewhere close to the office. I think I can catch him walking out of the building.”

“Excellent conditions. You did your homework.” He gave a small smile before his tone deepened in gravity. “Now, we are, of course, outside the law here, but I do want to make sure you understand all of your options and the possible outcomes. The machine can deposit you in the place and time you’ve requested - we’ll have it do some readings to optimize exact placement - but it will be up to you to do the rest. And you’ve agreed to attempt to impact others as little as possible. I see you’ve done the appropriate preparation,” nodding to her vintage jeans and denim jacket. “But I want to make sure, have you exhausted all your other options?”

She sighed heavily. “I’ve done everything, doctor - therapists, groups, meds, self-help books, acupuncture - everything. I’m done. I am exhausted. Everyday I wake up and wish that I hadn’t. And all I’ve done is make my loved ones anxious and depressed along with me. But I can’t kill myself. I can’t do that to them too.” Her voice grew with each statement as they rang increasingly truer to her feelings. She pulled her hair out of her face and looked him squarely in the eyes. “Misery like this shouldn’t be allowed in the first place. This seems like the best I can do for everyone.”

He matched her solemn gaze. “Okay. Then I want to help. But let me warn you, I cannot, with absolute certainty, tell you that this has ever worked or, to be frank, that it has ever been done before. I sit here everyday and chat with people on the darknet, people in your same predicament, but once you are gone, it will be as if we never spoke. There won’t be any interaction for me to remember because you will have never been. I only have a strong feeling that people have entered the machine for this purpose, and if that’s true, then the fact that I don’t remember could be proof that they have been successful. There is no way to be sure.”

“I’ll take my chances. It’s better if I never existed, but if it kills me, then at least I tried.”

“Alright.” Dr. Aevum sucked in a breath. “Remember, find your father and interact with him in a neutral way until, well, until you don’t exist. Depending on how it goes, your parents may have another child that is like you, but not exactly you.  Or they may decide to wait another year for children. Or your father could stay at work just a little later that night, meet someone new by chance, start an affair, and lead a wildly different life altogether. No one can promise that this will make it better for them. Only that you won’t be walking through my door today, asking to not exist. In the end, there really is no telling what this paradoxical Butterfly Effect will lead to.”

She took it all in silently. Her body ached from years of apathy punctuated by inexplicable sorrow. She was ready for the end and let Dr. Aevum know it. He showed her into a bright room filled with hundreds of wires connected to a large ceramic pod.

\*\*\*

That evening Dr. Aevum returned to his home office, opened his steno-pad, and ticked off another solitary day at the lab.
