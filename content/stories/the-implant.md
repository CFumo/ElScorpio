I think I used to think more… about myself, about everything. I could sit for hours alone and just roll around in my mind, replaying memories, reforming scenarios, imagining unrealized potentialities. During those stretches, my body fell into an intense stillness or else I was motoring through simple routines on autopilot. To the outside observer, I stood in the kitchen washing dishes with an odd air of quiet, but, in reality, deep in the folds of my cortex, I was delivering a biting retort to my boss’s latest sarcastic quip or seducing Ian from Product Development in a little black dress. The scenes enraptured me with their crystalline vibrancy before abruptly fading when externalities pelted my consciousness. What my cortex needed was a boost. Something that took those ideas, those gestures and words, and rendered them beyond the confines of my skull.

Before the implant, wisdom was my virtue, thoughtfulness my directive, and introversion my excuse. Everyone praised my listening skills. I was expert in the sympathetic nod. My forehead was forever crinkled with concern. My superego danced with social mores with the precision of an Olympic rhythmic gymnast. This gained me the respect and appreciation of a few close friends and colleagues. But I wasn’t particularly prized, certainly not the center of any attention. My wardrobe, which resembled the costuming of “Shy woman #2,” reinforced this arrangement. Nonetheless, despite the inhibited tendencies and silent frustrations of the terminally reserved, I was usually content. In general, I liked being me.

The ad appeared in the sidebar of a vintage clothing site I was perusing. Right there, next to a khaki blazer I was contemplating:

*STUDY VOLUNTEERS WANTED*

*Eligibility requirements:*

*Click for details!*

Its serif font flashed neon green and magenta in a way in which no modern marketing department should have ever approved. However, the content of the message struck a chord. Later I would tell people that the psychology major in me was simply intrigued, so… I clicked.

What they can do now with MRIs and cortical volumetry analysis software is pretty impressive. After a slew of tests and interviews and forms with all manner of fine print, I woke up one afternoon with an IV in my arm and a dull ache in my head. The neurosurgeon told me to take at least a week off of everything to let my brain rest and waved me out the door as soon as I could pass all of the basic neurological exams. I hadn’t told anyone about the procedure, but with Uber and GrubHub it didn’t matter much.

The research team warned me that I would likely experience migraines during the initial period of accelerated dendritic growth. It was a five month process that felt painstakingly incremental at the time, but I remember it now as a whirlwind.

The first thing I did after settling in for my stint of recovery was go online and purchase my little black dress. Once the aura subsided and I could walk around without nausea, I went back to work. Co-workers fretted over the head bandages. And where I had previously been absolutely sure I wouldn’t tell anyone about what I had undergone, I found myself almost bragging about the Personality Enhancement Implant. I used the buzz about the surgery as a canvas for expressive experimentation. I was going to bring out the outgoing nature through heartier laughs, firmer handshakes, and smoother storytelling. Finally, it was my turn on center stage.

There was a mixed response among the people I knew. To me it seemed that the closer I was to someone, the more likely they were to go wide-eyed with disbelief. For some the disbelief hardened into resentment.

“You’ve changed.”

“Sometimes I miss the old Lisa.”

“I want my friend back!”

I lost my oldest and best friend in the end. I made new friends. My preferences changed. I don’t even know why I never liked parties before. Well, I do. It was the half-second pause before I could say anything that usually meant I was silent in a group. It could be even worse in meetings. I previously assumed it was because I was slow or stupid, but as I began to rewire, I realized the truth: the lively gestures and clever words were always there in real time; my prefrontal cortex just had always worked so diligently that they drowned in perpetual analysis. These days, that buzz of observations and annotations only hums in the background. I am more here than I have ever been. I’m not who I was. I’m not *not *that person either.

When the research center sent the letter that was meant to reveal whether I received the implant or the placebo, I threw it over a flame unopened and watched it burn. I still have good days and bad days. My role as confidant has transformed into that of conductor. In some ways, it’s lonelier; in others, more gratifying. I’m not who I always wanted to be, but I don’t feel like being anyone else. I still like being me.
