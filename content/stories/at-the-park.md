I was sitting on a park bench, examining some red and gold flowers, when a little bird flew down into the clover some feet from me. It deftly hopped and scratched for a moment, and then it did something that shocked and delighted me: it flew directly for me and alighted on my shoulder. I held absolutely still. The bird ruffled its feathers, and sang a few notes of its pretty little song, as if it had no fear of me. Still astounded, I quietly unsheathed my claws. I'd never had a meal come to me before.
