A smartly dressed technician greeted Lisa as she tied her shoes after the security checkpoint.

“Good morning Lisa, I’m Rob. I’ll be onboarding you today. You’ll have to leave any network-capable devices here at the security desk. You can pick them up on your way out. Oh, and here’s your security card. You need it with you at all times for the security systems to verify your identity.”

Lisa chuckled under her breath at Rob’s civility and took the card. It had a prominent blue stripe and was labeled “*Lisa Hall, Information Control Specialist. Clearance Code: Blue*”

Rob guided her into an elevator and swiped his own blue security card.

“Server Room Four please,” he said, and the elevator closed its doors and began descending.

“As you know, our primary work involves the growth and training of artificial intelligences for government applications. But that’s not what we do in this building, and it’s not why you’re here. You’re here because… well I guess there’s no easy way to put this. We’re about to enter the second phase of testing a time machine that we built as an R&D project. And before you ask, yes it does work. And no, we haven’t sent life forms through it yet.”

Lisa ruminated on this idea for a few moments before speaking.

“I assume you don’t want people finding out about it because of the amount of attention you’d get, or whatever?”

“Precisely. Even assuming we wanted the news coverage, which we don’t, there would be considerable risk of espionage and sabotage. Which is why we’ve created the Information Control Specialist position."

The elevator doors opened and a gust of incredibly hot air blew in. Lisa stumbled backward, shielding her face.

“Sorry,” said Rob. “Keeping this thing cool and isolated from the outside world has been a bit of a challenge. It’s about 130 degrees in here, but you’ll probably get used to it.”

Rob led Lisa to a nearby console and tapped the screen to wake it up. A series of progress bars and odd looking web URLs flashed onscreen.

“Due to the ultra sensitive nature of our project, we have to have very precise control over the spread of information regarding what we’re working on. Obviously everyone here is sworn to secrecy but that’s not nearly enough. This is where our AI Japheth comes in. Japheth lives in this server room, and his job is to regularly download the *entire internet* in exabyte chunks and transfer the data to a quarantined server farm where it can be safely scanned for information leaks involving this facility or the time machine.”

“Wait,” said Lisa, “why do you care about finding leaks after they’ve happened? What difference does it make?”

Rob stared blankly at Lisa.

“We have a time machine.”

“Oh… holy shit.”

Rob smiled and produced a handful of colored envelopes.

“Your job will be to double check Japheth’s analyses and, if he is correct, send the relevant information back to yourself in the past so that you can prevent the security leak before it happens. For security reasons, you’ll have to write physical letters. Each of these envelope colors corresponds to a security clearance and has an associated maximum range. White envelopes can only be sent back as much as 24 hours. Green envelopes are allowed as far back as a week. Blue envelopes get a full month, and red envelopes get a year. In the case that something goes *catastrophically *wrong, a black envelope requires top-level security clearance and can be sent all the way back to the moment the machine was created, if necessary. Is this still making sense?”

Lisa nodded.

“Japheth has been online for about a month now and we’ve already prevented a few minor information leaks. Interestingly, we’ve never actually had to *write *any letters. We always receive them prior to the leak, prevent the leak, and then put the same letter back into an envelope and send it again on its sent-date. We’ve been adding little tick marks to the letters before we send them back to see if we can persist information across time loops. So far it seems to be working; every letter we’ve received has had at least a few tick marks on it… in fact preexisting tick marks on some of the letters were what gave us the idea in the first place. We haven’t quite unraveled that mystery yet.”

Another technician walked up from the direction of the elevator and handed Rob a sealed black envelope.

“Oh, this is addressed to you,” he said, handing it to Lisa. “But before you open it, I should probably tell you something. The whole idea for this envelope system came from an envelope that we received immediately after building the machine. Shortly thereafter we started getting… spam. We get a lot of envelopes with a lot of false information that seems to have been written out of the timestream. Sometimes they sound pretty dire and crazy. We’re fairly certain that it’s safe to ignore them.”

Lisa took a deep breath and opened her envelope from the future. The letter was nearly unreadable, but it was definitely her own writing. Partially obscured by hundreds of tick marks was a single sentence that read: *“Do not use the time machine.”*
