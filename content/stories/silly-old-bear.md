The funeral took place in the vegetable patch at Rabbit's house. They dug the grave under the old oak at the corner of the yard, where a beehive buzzed softly in the branches. Piglet couldn't think of anywhere Pooh would rather be buried.

Tigger was completely inconsolable, sobbing uncontrollably and refusing to look in the casket. Piglet peered into the casket and noted with distaste the black shirt Rabbit had forced him into. *He shouldn't be buried in that shirt*, thought Piglet. An empty honeypot was tucked under Pooh's arm. At least he had that.

"I always figured I'd be the first one to go," muttered Eeyore.

Owl cleared his throat and shuffled his notecards.

"Dear friends, we are gathered here today to mourn the passing of our dear friend and neighbor, Winnie the Pooh. Pooh and I were very close, and I can honestly say that I never met a gentler soulâ€¦"

Piglet killed himself two nights later.
