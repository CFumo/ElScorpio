*Crunch Crunch Crunch Crunch. *

The thin layer of hardened snow breaks under my weight. The crisp sound faded into background long ago.

I meet the gaze of the ubiquitous stars; the whorls of steam reach out towards them.

There is no sensation of chill. The cold air no longer numbs the flesh of my extremities. Only the stinging intake of breath belies the dangerous temperature.

I move or I die.

The endless locomotion is comforting in its purpose. Fitting to follow the steel of railroad tracks.

I think I hear an engine behind me. The only reason to stop and hide. Away from the electric lights, I take reprieve on a snowbank near the trees.

Gliding slowly on the tracks, the snaking construct seems to go on forever. Iâ€™m aware of the comforting cold seeping into my bones, abating the furnace inside.

It passes. I look skyward once more, greeted by vast space. Nothing fills my ears. I drink the void.

I feel myself walking once more. This purgatory has a path.

*Crunch Crunch Crunch Crunch.*
