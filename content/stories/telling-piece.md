For yonder sooth, forgotten naught,

eternal life shall be begot

and failures grand the flames lick up

whilst ergot breeds with time defined.

Your light dims brightly to my eye

when all the rest are turning blind.

A slip of silver to the hand

a swift sea ride across the damned.

The visions taken from the gods

enlightenment is now acquired.

But this be fate to envy not-

a madman’s mantle weighs so great.

A written scribble I had writ years back

will course command in reader’s dying mind.
