Everyone knows there was a god.

No one knows what happened. Nothing else changed. But everyone knows now.

Catholics know there was a god.  Canadians know there was a god. Dolphins know there was a god. A96479-ians know there was a god. Toddlers know there was a god. Atheists know there was a god.

In a flash of incomprehensible comprehension, they learned the Truth: *there was a god and now there is not. *

Most beings were doing nothing of consequence at the time. All were taken by surprise. Some felt it like a hollowness; others like freedom, vindication, despondence, confusion, comfort. Some wars ended. Others flared. The contemplative contemplated while actors acted and worlds turned.

The Day of Knowledge spawned a million cults of mystic nihilism, which took the place of some religions, but mostly worlds turned.
