Dear all. I told you so, assholes.

Never trusted the damn elevator. Ever since Jerry & Co. Elevator Repair Company decided to use our building as a test zone for their new Gater-vators, my morning commute from the garage to the 20th floor was a nightmare.

“Don’t worry, George! This Jerry guy says the Gater-vator is the latest tech out there! Using scrapings from alligator skulls is the future of automated building systems. ‘The reliable, smart future of building transportation,’ Jerry says. Besides, think of the savings! These guys won’t charge repair fees and they even waived the installation cost!”

Well, Bucky- fuck you. Because of your dumbass cost-cutting measures, I’m gonna get eaten by this goddamn elevator. You DO know that the toner you buy for your piece of shit printer ends up costing us almost TWICE what we paid for our building upkeep? Christ!

Oh- there we go. The shudders. I’m feeling the queer spasms of the elevator walls. This Gatervator’s been getting more aware of its predicament. It started with the reflexive slamming of the doors. Once, a USPS worker’s arm got jammed in the door. Took three people with prybars to rescue that woman’s maimed appendage. Good old Jerry came out to “fix” the elevator by jabbing the walls with a cattle-prod.

After that, there was an obvious change in the Gater-vator. No one else believed me, but I could tell that I was being studied by the camera inside. Meant to be used by Jerry’s Patented Learning Program™ to increase elevator productivity, the camera became the Gator-vator’s unblinking eye of judgment. The doors would sometimes take too long to open, and you could FEEL the camera staring right at you. You know what I mean, Cheryl. I remember how you ran out of there in a panic last week.

At some point, the contraption started growing teeth. Little buds of calcium hidden within the foam door protectors. You could see them if you paid attention. The walls acquired a ridge like quality. Buck, you said that ALL elevators have that. You’re an idiot. Elevators don’t start growing scales on the inside. And the way you explained away the moist floors- that it was the Mexican cleaner ladies spilling chemicals… Are you fucking kidding me? What kind of chemical feels like saliva and smells like sea life? You really killed me, Bucky. This is all you fault, Bucky. FUCK YOU, BUCKY.

Well, I think the time is coming. The walls are starting to get closer. I heard that alligators have strong stomach acid. What a shitty way to go. I’m gonna send this email company-wide. And I’ve CCed that cute reporter from Channel 9. I hope your criminal negligence gets you a fucking LIFETIME in prison, Buck. You too, Allison. Brown-nosing bitch- you KNEW the Gator-vator was dangerous.

Shit shit shit shit. My shoes as starting to simmer. I think the saliva is getting acidic. No time left to give each one of you assholes a personal fuck you. So, fuck you all. FUCK YOU. YOU KILLED ME.
