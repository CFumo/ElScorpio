*Prompt, Auðunn Axel Ólafsson: "Help, my interior designer is literally Hitler!"*

To Mr. Ernst Krämer, Director of the Schönes Design Firm:

I am writing to express my sincere discontent with services provided by the interior designer you sent to me, Mr. Adolf Hitler. During my initial meeting with Mr. Hitler, he assured me with ardent enthusiasm and great flamboyance that my greatest expectations for the design of my home would be met and exceeded. I described to him my desire for a residence that would afford me great comfort and space for reflection. He assured me of the perfection that was to sweep across the domicile from the foyer to the kitchen, bedroom to bath. I had thought my expectations clear as we discussed the inclusion of tasteful motifs from my many travels abroad. Yet after a month’s absence, during which the decoration occurred, I and my family returned to find, not a warm and inviting manor into which we may welcome guests, but a pitiful imitation of Greco-Roman design, an austere temple of cold marble and imposing symmetry. It is simply ghastly.

Please allow me to elaborate upon a sample of the sources of my aesthetic displeasure.

Chief among these is the library, upon which my highest hopes had been set. My room for retirement is bereft of any semblance of ease or fittings for relaxation. The walls are plain; the arrangement is sparse. There is only one sigil of personal affectation, a peculiar affectation, one which I must emphasize is not my own: a repeated pattern of golden eagles in the form of statues and engravings. I do not know what inspired the insertion of this tawdry icon, but to me it conveys the designer’s craving for a formidability he cannot possess. Indeed, he has proven to be a man truly worthy of insult. Mr. Hitler’s mark upon this room is not only unfashionable, it is criminal. As I have been writing in this chamber of garish insensibility, I have come to realize that certain of my books on the subject of politics are missing. Thus, in addition to a full refund of my expenses, I fully anticipate the return of my manuscripts and the removal of this vandal from your employ.

While I believe you will agree that the library and my missing texts are reason enough to dismiss the man, Mr. Krämer, you must know the greater extent of Mr. Hitler’s incompetence.

The décor of the children’s playroom is wholly unacceptable. Upon the largest wall is a rather amateur and crude mural in which an ill-proportioned dog sits awkwardly among a bed of simple daisies. The unsophisticated nature of the work could have been overlooked if the sheer clumsiness of the form did not result in a hell-hound of frightening countenance. My wife and I have been made to cover it with a drape so as not to frighten our youngest. As what seems to be a matter of course, it appears Mr. Hitler enterprised to hand-paint the unsightly creature himself. His signature, which - despite an overall ineptitude for the art - he seems to have taken great pains to perfect, dominates the corner over the toy chest.

You may endeavor to imagine the selection of “artistic” ills that now plague the remainder of my home though you would find me surprised if your inner-sight could adequately capture the poor taste exemplified all around. Of course, I invite you to visit the site for yourself in order to assess the damages in full. At this juncture, I feel it would have been more prudent to attempt to line the walls with marks myself and will take my business elsewhere for repairs.

I expect a swift reply.

Sincerely,

Mr. Jonas Böhm

P. S.

Please inform Mr. Hitler that society has no interest in a book in which he details his “struggles.”

“Adolf,” says the director, his gaze burning into the young man before him, “You botched a third commission. I cannot give you any more chances. Every time the customer is not only disappointed, but upset by your work. This is it. You’re fired. No pay for this last one. Clean out your desk and go home.”

The young man sat slumped, wounded by the words of rejection, then angered by them. He straightened up, felt the stolen text under his coat, and growled in reply, “Fine. If my art is ‘unacceptable,’ as you say, then perhaps it is time that I find a new occupation."
