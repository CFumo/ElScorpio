Eddie Willers glanced around at Dagny and James Taggart, and at Francisco d'Anconia. They were standing in a forest of naked, twisted trees, and snow drifted down slowly all around them. It was a familiar place, but something was dreadfully wrong.

"I thought we were too old to return to Narnia," said Dagny, a line of worry forming between her eyes.

Eddie remembered too well how he, Francisco, and the two Taggart children had discovered Narnia through their Uncle Wyatt's wardrobe, and had helped overturn the dreadful communist regime of the White Witch. James had been tempted by her socialist policies at first—he was always the most weak-minded of the children—but with the help of the faun Mr. Moneybags, they rescued James and helped Aslan the Argent deliver his famous fifteenhour-speech to the citizens of Naria.

When they'd left, Naria had been a prosperous land entering into a golden era of capitalism. But now the trees around them were dead, and the earth cracked and dry. The sky was dark, the air was thick with a foul stench, and a mournful silence blew on the wind.

"And if this is Naria," continued Dagny, "what on earth happened to it?"

"It's snowing again," said James.

"This isn't snow," said Francisco, rubbing some of the powder between his fingers. "It's ash."

Dagny leaned into him and he tightened his grip on her shoulder. Eddie felt a twinge of jealousy, as he always did when he saw them together.

"I'm going to see if I can find anyone," he said quickly, and stalked off. He didn't have to go far before a huge golden lion emerged from the dark trees.

"Aslan!" cried Eddie, and threw his arms around the lion's neck. As the youngest, he had always had a special affection for their guardian, above and beyond the respect felt by the others. "Wait here while I get the others."

Soon they were all gathered around Aslan, and questions tumbled from their lips.

"Aslan, where is everybody?" asked Francisco.

"They have gone," said the lion.

"And why has the earth gone so cold and dreary?" asked James.

"The earth is dead," came the reply.

"But I don't understand!" cried Dagny. "What happened to capitalism? To rational egoism and individual rights?"

Aslan tilted his head unnaturally, gave them a ghastly smile, and said, "Who is John Galt?"
