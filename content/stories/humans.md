Hek's little human partner exhibited some peculiar behaviors. For one thing, every day she washed off all the oils naturally produced by her skin and replaced them with artificial onesâ€”"lotion." For another, toward the end of her shift she'd start taking huge, loud breaths intermittently. If other humans were near they would imitate her unconsciously. On their first day together he'd returned from a shift and found her unconscious and drooling on a mat on the floor.

He'd shaken her and said: "Miriam, get up! What's wrong!"

She'd said: "I was sleeping, jackass!"

She'd then explained the nature and function of "sleep." Imagine spending all those hours unconscious and vulnerable every day! How had her species survived? Another time he'd entered the latrine and found her bleeding from a reproductive orifice. From his experience with humans in combat he knew that amount of blood to be concerning. But she assured him it was perfectly normal and explained all about "menstruation" and human reproduction. Yes, humans were strange alright, but he was getting used to it.
