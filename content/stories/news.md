Reduction in Helium Production

In an effort to reduce mankind's helium footprint in the galaxy, the Solar administration proposed a reduction in the output of the Sun by 20 over the next 10 years.

The Panel of Concerned Citizens question whether such a plan is even feasible, given the influence of Big Solar on the world stage.

Old Rivals to Merge

The Martian Coalition of United Republics and Mr. Venus agreed to merge the two planets in a maneuver that would result in a new planet that would rival Earth, their main competitor in the inner Solar System.

The surprise trillion dollar merger between Mars and Venus has drawn heavy criticism from environmentalists who say the merger would result in an uninhabitable planet, an unstable Solar System and would destroy the century long terraforming projects on the two planets.

Mr. Venus, sole inhabitant and self-proclaimed King of Venus, claims it's great news for the economy: "This merger is going to be the biggest yet, so of course everyone is worried. But I want to make sure that everyone knows that it's going to happen, because I really want it to happen. I am very excited about working with the Martians to complete this merger. There is nothing in the world quite like healthy competition, and I understand Earth's concerns about finally having some but come on. It's going to be great for everyone."

CUR leadership expressed similar sentiments, claiming among other things that Earth will "just finally" have to deal with it not being the center of the "free fucking world" anymore.

Terran leaders appeared generally perplexed but mostly indifferent over the proposed merger. French President Chaler Labelle, in an interview with Verizon! Views' Claire Reynolds, said earlier: "If it gets them to shut up about how hard they have it over there, I'm all for it," which drew some criticism from the Panel of Concerned Citizens, who question whether leaders on Earth should have any opinions at all about anything outside Earth.
