It was getting close to the deadline, and given the number of submissions I'd received by that point, it looked like we were gearing up to drop the shortest issue of El Scorpio so far. Less work for me! I told myself as I attended to some pre-deadline editing business. I was reading one of Zhenya's PoMo mind vomit pieces when I started to feel a little inspired. I'm usually pretty proud of my work, but my own writing process is very deliberative and careful, and suddenly I wanted to try writing something a bit more loosely-penned. I figured this would be a low-key issue, and no one would notice if I slipped in something really wacky and meaningless.

So on Tuesday night I sat down with a glass of Bailey's and wrote The Crown of John Barleycorn. I guess it was a little "messed up"; enough to make me feel sort of gross for having written it, but not enough to warrant self-rejection. (What bias?) I typed it up and carried on. The next night I read it to Cosmo over Thai food. He didn't seem all that excited about it, but that was fine. It was sort of meandering and senseless, but that was the price of ease of composition. Mission accomplished.

The next night I was lying in bed, rubbing one out—typical Thursday stuff—when I glanced up from my computer and saw someone standing in my room. For anyone who doesn't know this, I live alone, so obviously I flipped out, like crying and hyperventilating and shit. And it quickly became apparent that the figure wasn't human, which was no comfort.

I know you're thinking that you see where this is going: Rachel's in her room, jerking off, maybe she's had a glass of wine or two, and suddenly a Hot Demon appears. Every month is erotica month now. Well, cue ironic drumroll… I'll just say… the demon was not hot.

Here's what it wanted: Just like thirteen age-old monkeys finally cranking out Act I of King Lear, it turns out that if you write enough Satanic horror stories, your chances of accidentally writing something sorta true go way up. This demon appeared in my bedroom to tell me that I must not under any circumstances publish John Barleycorn in the April issue of El Scorpio. Furthermore I was to destroy the document without showing it to anyone. I very carefully avoided saying that I'd already read it to someone, but my discretion was unnecessary. The demon told me that the "Fumo character" had already unknowingly seen several infernal documents and was being monitored.

I of course assumed that I was experiencing a vivid dream or hallucination. I didn't voice my assumption—what would be the point?— but I did ask what would happen if I were to ignore the warning and publish it anyway. The demon told me that if more than eight people saw what I'd written, the revelation of evil could cause a chain reaction that would drive every last human past the point of insanity and turn the planet into a festering hellpit. A good short-term outcome but a poor long-term one, it said. When I tried to explain that I didn't think more than eight people would read it, I was silenced. Then the demon burned the notebook pages I'd written the story on, and loomed over my shoulder as I deleted the Word document.

The next morning, the notebook pages and the Word doc were still gone, so that part of the night had been real, at least. Had I just saved the planet from some kind of memetic apocalypse? Or had I consigned it to some more insidious fate?
