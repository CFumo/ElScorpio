The morning sun swept across the bedroom as Alice threw open the curtains. Her husband yanked the sheets over his face and rolled over in semi-conscious protest.

“Upsy-daisy, lazy!” Alice chimed.  She received a muffled groan in response. A quick debate ran through her mind about hopping into bed and stealing the sheets to hasten the process, but she decided on a softer approach. “C’mon, hun. Coffee’s ready. I’ll get Nathan ready for school.” She tousled his hair a little. “Thanks for taking care of baby Cece last night.” They had been taking turns with 2 a.m. infant care.

The room fell quiet as her bare feet stepped speedily down the hall.

Adam felt heavy beneath the quilt comforter. His neurons struggled to coalesce random firings into movement. First, an arm stretched haphazardly from his cocoon of cotton. Then, a leg. It took enormous effort to propel his body into sitting and several moments for the haze to clear from his head. After dragging himself off the bed, he curled his toes into the carpet, releasing a deep yawn.

The image in the full-length mirror next to the bed followed suit. “I’m up,” he croaked blearily. He stopped to examine the ponderous circles under his eyes. He couldn’t remember the last time he was this tired. The office would be hell today. In an attempt to pump some life into his being, he extended his arms overhead and leaned from side to side. Several gratifying pops sounded from his back and hips.

Then Adam noticed a flicker on the mirror. Some shift of color happened. There was a strangeness to the look of his blue arrow tattoo in the image. He grabbed his right arm reflexively and looked down at it in disbelief. The long line up his forearm was not as he expected. It was thinner and greener. And something was missing, like a word or a name.

He puzzled over what the change was as he stumbled over to the bathroom and took a shower. It had been less than a year since he got the blue, now blue-green, arrow done. The single line didn’t transform again in the bathroom mirror though he half-expected it to. Adam kept glancing down at the shape in vague confusion. However, as he toweled off, he found himself much more well-rested. His mood lifted with the dissipating steam and he rapidly forgot his concerns. Today was going to be a great day at the office.

When he stepped out of the bathroom, Adam found his wife Alice sleeping peacefully in bed next to Nathan, their only child, their little boy. A slit of sun streaked across her left cheek and a few tendrils of his chestnut hair.

He leaned over to kiss their foreheads. “Upsy-daisy, lazies,” he whispered gently.

Ten years later, time travel that supports human transport is invented. A small number of government and military officials are permitted access to this technology. Highly trained scouts are sent to engage in minimal interaction with citizens of the relatively recent past in order to measure the potential risks and benefits. Due to ethical concerns, the program is quickly shut down with each trial providing mounting evidence of subtle yet substantial impact to civilian lives.
