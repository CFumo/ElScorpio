Twelve to fourteen dour men in lab coats and thick glasses huddled around the low-humming machine.  Also, there were exactly three women, and they were uncomfortable. “Hey guys, so uh… here it is! The fruits of 34 years of research, I guess.”

“THIRTY FOUR YEARS?! Why, but you’re only 26?!” exclaimed The Oldest and Baldest of the Scientists.

“Exactly!” said Cosmo, pointing at the man and grinning.

There was an audible gasp from the audience. Several pens dropped to the floor. Barbara Chang fell to her knees in disbelief.

Cosmo typed furiously at the console attached to the machine. Images began appearing on the screens around the room. Windows into different places, *different times*!

“GREAT SCOTT!” Doctor Geoffrey Peters bellowed directly into Lester Bohr’s ear. Lester was not pleased, but was too enthralled by Cosmo’s brilliance to be distracted.

“So yeah, I uh, made a time machine,” said Cosmo, scratching the back of his head.

Stephen Hawking was so overwhelmed by the brilliance that he stood and applauded.

“I’m going back to do, well, something with a lot of political significance. So make sure you’re recording, alright?”

Without further ado, he stepped through the glowing portal of the time machine, into the past. The audience watched as Cosmo stumbled into the heavy pedestrian traffic of 1993 Pyongyang, then quickly backed into the shadows, slinging his grappling hook out of his backpack and shucking his lab coat to reveal a skin-tight ninja suit.

The men of science gasped. The women of science were mildly surprised.

Chester Plutonium turned his head sharply and stage-whispered to Darla Chang: “My god. Is he planning to assassinate Kim Jong-il?”

Overhearing them, Tiny Phistter felt tears well in his eyes. “My god. So noble and self-sacrificing.”

Debbie Riamezzo sighed extravagantly. “*God, *I *hate *time travel...  *and *Darla...”

They watched, rapt, as Cosmo scaled the stark government building, avoiding all of the security guards, and snuck through the open window like a softly-blowing breeze. He was in Kim Jong-il’s bedroom.

“Mother of *God! *He’s really gonna do it! He’s going to assassinate Kim Jong-il!” screamed Darla Chang.

“Shut *UP*, Darla!” hissed Debbie.

Cosmo loomed darkly over the four-poster bed of Kim Jong-il. He put his hand on the dictator’s shoulder and shook it gently.

“Wake up,” he said. Kim Jong-il	’s eyes opened slowly, eyelashes fluttering against his plump cheeks. Cosmo leaned down, slowly, slowly, and pressed his lips to the dictator’s.

“Holy fucking shit what,” said Stephen Hawking. He sat back down.

“What the fuck!!” shouted Lester, and covered his face with his hands. Geoffrey’s jaw dropped.

“My god…” said Barbara, her cheeks going red. She felt her cloven tuft grow moist. She couldn’t look away.

But what startled them most was Kim Jong-il’s reaction. He leaned hungrily into the kiss, running his fingers up into Cosmo’s hair and pulling him roughly down onto the bed. “I’ve been waiting for you, time traveller,” he rasped in between kisses.

Cosmo growled against his neck, and bit down on the sensitive flesh, drawing a sharp gasp out of his lover. The dictator’s puckered asshole quivered with excitement as he collapsed onto his back, ready to receive his powerful, extra-temporal visitor.

“I’m ready,” said Kim Jong-il, staring deeply and passionately into Dr. Fumo’s eyes.

“Not yet,” said Cosmo, unzipping both his and the dictator’s pants while continuing to thrust his tongue down his partner’s throat. Cosmo’s freshly exposed battering ram oozed with excitement over Kim Jong-il’s dong. The dictator’s hands instinctively rubbed around his four-inch thick and one-inch long manhood. Cosmo slapped his baloney pony against the head of his partner’s, drawing mewling whimpers from the engorged despot. They vigorously frotted with reckless abandon for what felt to them like hours.

“Please, time traveller… I need it,” Kim Jong-il begged. Cosmo knew he was ready, but teasing his autocratic partner was simply too exciting for him.

“Yeah? How bad do you need it. Show me.” Cosmo leaned back and waited for his partner to perform. Kim Jong-il	 immediately and obediently flipped around. Spreading his ass cheeks, he let the head of Cosmo’s flesh trumpet rest gently on his tongue, awaiting his next command.

Cosmo stroked the dictator’s hair, grinning tauntingly. “That’s a good boy. Get her nice and wet. This is the only lube I’m using.”

Kim Jong-il’s	 eyes lit up with excitement and desperation. He ravenously swallowed every inch of Cosmo’s foaming beef probe. A puddle of saliva and precum was pooling on the bed when Cosmo flipped his partner over. He maintained perfect eye contact as he prepared his trouser snake to enter the tyrant’s gaping manhole.

Back in the present, the eminent scientists looked on with an incendiary mixture of horror and fascination. Lester Bohr bent over and vomited noisily on his shoes.

Desperate with desire, Debbie turned to Darla and pressed her plump lips to the other female scientist’s lips. Debbie reached down and slowly dragged her manicured finger up the slit of Darla’s trousers. Darla moaned luxuriantly.

Kim Jong-il	 screamed hellaciously with even the tiniest movement of Cosmo’s anus impaler. The whole thing was as annoying as it was sweaty. Both parties climaxed in about 12 seconds. Neither were particularly satisfied.

“When will I see you again?” Kim Jong-il	 asked coyly, lying naked in bed and watching Cosmo get dressed.

“Exactly one year from now,” Cosmo replied, looking at his extremely high-tech SCIENCE WATCH.

“But… But that’s so long from now!” protested the dictator.

Cosmo tousled the tyrant’s hair, and lifted the man’s chin with his finger. “Well, it’ll only be an hour for me. And that’s all that matters.”
