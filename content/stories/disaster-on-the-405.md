[09/09/18 - 09:30:31 Query with KJon started]

9:30 <PortalMan69> What was this meaning of the phrase that we are "up shit street" if I'm wrong about the negligible effect of positron spray? By the way, I am not wrong about it.

9:31 <KJon> I was just kidding

9:31 <PortalMan69> I just find it's interesting, that's all. It's such a funny phrase, and your inflection. But why it is like this, "up shit street" and not "up feces avenue", I will never know.

11:49 <KJon> so we have a little situation

11:50 <PortalMan69> ?

11:50 <KJon> massive spike, looks like an inversion

11:50 <KJon> i need to show u

11:50 <KJon> were down in lab

11:51 <PortalMan69> Unfortunately I am engaged in a very difficult and time sensitive activity. It would be unfortunate if I am to cease my progress, as it could set the work back by all the duration to which I have currently spent this session, which has lasted over 30 hours by my best estimate. I used a stopwatch so my estimation is highly accurate. ;-)

11:51 <PortalMan69> If you will only explain, I can find break in the session where it would be appropriate to necessitate a cessation)))))

11:52 <KJon> situation critica;l

11:52 <KJon> please b wuick all control gone

11:52 <KJon> kathrin gone

11:52 <KJon> theres no power bu t the field ownt shut

Fyodor paused his game of Tetris and floated down the long central hall of the research station. On arriving at the lab, it was immediately clear that an experiment with the portals had yielded a very salient result. Admittedly it looked a little dangerous, what with  large sections of the room being in the process of slowly getting misaligned. Tables, equipment, posters, walls, the entire lab was cut up into large pieces, each one misplaced, folded on each other, each one missing large sections.

"Mr. Krinal!" Karl yelled relieved to see Theo. "The field breach is ongoing, and by my estimate it's getting worse." "Did you use a stopwatch in your estimation?" Krinal asked. Karl wasn't sure if that was a joke. "Well, no." "Okay, okay. It's ok not to, but stopwatch is better for this, for logging purpose. Have you thrown the wrench yet?" "Yes, as soon as the field inverted we shut it all down." "But the wrench?" "Like I said, everything was shut down. Katherine tried to do something but she disappeared into that-" he paused to gesture at the phenomenon that had engulfed the lab, and was on its way to engulf Earth if it wasn't stopped within an hour and a half.

It had already touched down on an area perpendicular to the station, which just so happened to be a small portion of the 405, a major Interstate Highway in Southern California. The opposing lanes appeared to lead into each other, and disaster struck when people attempted to avoid crashing into on-coming traffic. A few were unsuccessful at stopping in time, causing them to disappear into the missing sections. A few cars bumped into decelerating ones in front. Repairs would end up becoming pretty costly for over a dozen people.

"K-jon-" "That's my handle. I'm Karl. Jonson." "Listen very hard to me now. Have you thrown the wrench yet?" Karl wasn't sure what he meant, "I'm not sure what you mean." "Wrench! The wrench! Did you throw the wrench at the frames?" he didn't pause for an answer before looking around for a wrench to throw. He picked one out of a toolbelt hanging near and threw at the portal sitting far. He missed. "Блядь!" He picked every instrument out one by one and threw at the portal. A tiny watchmakers screwdriver grazed the frame of one of the portals, which immediately brought a halt to the shenanigans and snapped the pieces of the lab into place. Katherine floated unconscious.

Karl flew down to her and prepared to move her to the tiny medical area on the huge station. "Unusual," Theo remarked. "I haven't seen anyone go unconscious from this." "This happens often?" Karl asked. "?" Theo's face responded. "Yes, it happens. Often? Subjective. No, on this scale it does never happen before. Are you new here?" "Yeah, I'm Karl. Jonson." "Yes, that's ok." Theo floated back to his Tetris game without any further explanations for the new guy.

Katherine was fine, she had just hyperventilated when she entered another dimension.

The 405 carried on as normal after a while. A few riders reported whiplash.
