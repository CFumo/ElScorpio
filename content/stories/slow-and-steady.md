*"In a world of anthropomorphic animals, two sloths get it on (bonus for a sloth orgy)." - Samantha Valasek*

Early morning at the Microsoft campus gym. Rick and Sandra are the only ones in the cardio room. Just two sloths looking to get fit before the midmorning rush.

R: Today’s the day I’m hitting a bench PR, bro.

S: Yeah? It certainly looks like it. You start the provo cycle?

R: Fuck yeah. Also doing the Stanazolol.

S: Isn’t that for the end of the cycle?

R: Dude. That’s the usual thing, but Norm got an extra shipment this quarter. And this shit goes bad.

S: Yeah dude. No reason to waste that juice.

They down their pre-workout and start on the ellipticals.

Minutes later, Jack Mouse wanders into the room.

J: Heh. You sloths going fast on those running machines?

S: Go fuck yourself, big-ears. Don’t harsh my flow.

R: Are you fucking kidding me, rat motherfucker? That shit’s out of line, you racist piece of shit.

J: Whoa whoa! It was just a joke! Just because you’re-

R: A couple of sloths.

J: A couple… yeah. Sloths.

S: And sloths are slow.

J: Well… yeah.

S: You look here, vermin. If you think we’re so slow, you wouldn’t have a problem running out of this room from us, right?

R: Because if we catch you, we’re gonna tear that tail off.

S: But you’re not scared of that, right? We’re sloths, after all.

J: Whoa whoa… hey guys, c’mon…

S: Go fuck yourself, Jack. Get out before someone gets hurt.

Jack scurries away to leave the two jacked sloths to finish their cardio in peace.

Rick and Sandra spend the next two hours doing core, back, and arms. It is a fulfilling day at the weights. It is near 8 in the morning, and the two need to get to their morning scrums. But they need to get clean first.

R: Good reps, man. Killing it with those head crushers!

S: Yeah. I’m really feeling it. I KNEW you were gonna PR today!

R: Holy shit, yeah. Finally broke 500!

S: Siiiick!

R: Aw, fuck, Sandra. Looks like the dude’s showers are closed for repair again.

S: That sucks, man.

R: Fuck, I gotta do a presentation in an hour. I won’t have time to BART home and back.

S: Just use the chicks’ showers, bro!

R: Hah. Yeah, I guess no one’s around. Let’s go. Cover for me!

The two grab gym towels and head to the women’s locker room.

S: Oh, there’s only one shower, bro. We’re gonna have to go together if we wanna make it to our meetings on time.

R: Oh shit.

S: Don’t be shy, dude!

R: Ha! Alright.

Sandra and Rick undress and hop into a stall. After minutes of lathering their furry sloth bodies, the ORGY begins.

S: Oh, dude. Excited much?

R: Yeah… It’s hard to not get hard when I see a beefcake like you undressed.

S: You wanna… you wanna have a go at each other?

R: Dude, yeah.

S: Dude… yeah.

Loyola and Emma, sloths from HR, are macking near the lockers when they hear the grunting coming from the single shower.

L: What’s this I hear here?

S: Loyola! Uhhh, there were just not enough showers and the guy’s room is closed and this is just really-

L: Relaaaaax, baby. We’re just sloths in a locker room. You know what that means?

E: Yeah. You know what that means?

R: Slorgy?

Everyone: Slorgy!

Hours pass as the four sloths fuck each other silly. Here’s the thing about sloths. They’re only slow when it comes to getting tired of fuckin’.

J: What’s all this, then?

S: Fuck off, Jack!

R: Wait wait wait… There aren’t enough dudes here. Maybe…

S: Yeah… Jack. Get over here. We need more holes filled.

J: I… I guess I can do that.

E: You better, because you’ll get a write-up from HR if you don’t perform well!

J: Really!?

L: No, silly. Just come here and stick that tail as far up my ass as you can.

They all had a really jolly good time.
