A crashed spacecraft laid in the crater that was once Uncle Joe’s pickup truck. Billy and Tom approached cautiously.

“Ya think it’s from some kind of NASA thing?” Billy scratched at a pimple on his forehead and craned his neck to see over the craft. “It doesn’t really look like any kinda spaceship I’ve seen.”

Tom sniffled and wiped his nose on his sleeve. “I bet it’s one of those Russian Sputniks or something, let’s try to open it up and see what’s inside.”

As the two boys approached, a hatch in the top of the craft hissed and slid open. A hideously skinny nine foot tall humanoid creature unfurled from within the ship and stood up. It’s face was stretched tight over its skull and eight large black eyes dominated the bottom half of its head. Above them was an anus-shaped fleshy hole that was contracting and dilating rapidly. The creature raised two bony mitten-like hands on the ends of its arms and a mass of thin, crimson tentacles unrolled from its palms like sickly fingers.

Scanning the horizon, the alien failed to notice Tom and Billy as they approached.

“Hey Mister! Are you some kind of alien?” said Billy, poking the creature in its greasy black shin.

The alien jumped and looked down at the boys, then recoiled in disgust.

“Christ, what the FUCK ARE *THOSE*!?” it screamed.

Tom tried to sniff a large glob of snot back into his nose and, failing, wiped his face again with his sleeve. The creature reeled and shielded all eight of its eyes.

“You… creatures of this planet… you can speak the voidspeak of my dimension!?”

Tom and Billy looked at each other, puzzled.

“You mean English?” said Tom, breathing heavily through his mouth.

“Please don’t touch me again,” it said, staring in horror at its uninvited hosts and slowly shrinking back toward its ship.

Billy laughed and said, “Haha, Tom, it’s totally grossed out by us. Do something nasty!”

The creature gave them a pleading look. Tom started trying to force his snot to drip down his face while Billy pulled his eyelids open and rolled his eyes back as far as he could.

The alien vomited from its forehead-anus and turned to look away from Tom and Billy.

“Okay, fuck. Fuck this planet. I’m calling off the invasion,” it said, climbing back into its spaceship.
