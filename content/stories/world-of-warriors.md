Stephen Curry, number 30 with the Golden State Warriors, was drinking a stout beer in a small Oakland brewery. He didn't know if frequenting these smaller places helped him keep a low profile or not, but the brew was good and the patrons were attractive. From his pocket, his phone buzzed with a message from his teammate, Draymond Green: "we still raidin’ tonite?"

Oops—he almost forgot. He texted back "yeah shit omw" then dropped his phone back into his pocket. On the walk back to his car he discreetly slipped several folded bills into the empty cup next to a sleeping homeless woman.

"A little preemptive reparation for all the damage I'm about to do," he thought, and chuckled to himself.

When he got back to his house—the girls were already asleep—he sat down at his computer, slipped on his headset, and opened up World of Warcraft.

Anderson Varejão, Festus Ezeli, and Klay Thompson were already assembled outside of Blackwing Lair. Varejão's character was a Draenei mage, and a bit of a glass cannon; she could pack a wallop, but one solid hit and she met the floor screaming. Ezeli played a human priest and acted as the party healer. As for Curry, he and Thompson played twin dwarf warriors and called themselves the "Smash Brothers."

"Alright Fes, let's lay this out," said Curry.

"Yeah Einstein," said Thompson, "what’s the plan?"

"I wish you wouldn't call me that…" said Ezeli.

That's when Green's character joined the party, riding a shaggy, decorated animal with huge horns.

"Hey, check me out guys," he said.

"Man, I don’t even wanna know how much you paid for that," said Varejão.

Curry shook his head. He used to wonder what Green did with all the money he saved living in Emeryville. By now he'd figured it out.

After Ezeli outlined their general strategy and they exchanged some items, the party began the battle with Vaelastrasz. The Smash Brothers were the first to jump in, swinging their hammers and laughing. Back at his computer, Curry pounded his chest with his fist, then pointed one finger toward the sky. He knew who he was playing for.
