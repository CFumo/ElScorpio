We've had slow but steady progress.

There is something hidden down there.

A great treasure.

They must have buried it and written the warnings so their enemies won't attempt a search.

The radioactive shielding was put in place to prevent us from digging further.

Could it hide the Lost City of Atlantis?

The location makes this plausible.

Our ancestors would have chosen a remote location, away from the decadence and sully of the Southern civilizations.

Only deep within the ground, where access would be guarded by these immense radioactive shields.

Knowledge of this place must have been lost millenia ago.

If only the shields could be turned off, the manpower we spend daily could be kept whole.

I do not need to tell you how many we are losing, or the wretched ways radioactivity eliminates our men.

It causes me great consternation to know that our knowledge of radioactivity has deteriorated so.

What power our ancestors wielded, ability to shut off the immensity of nuclear power with but a switch!

I thank the Jesuses we found the nuclear shields only in their twilight.

We could not even attempt to be near to them should we have come upon them in their prime.

But that was, of course, the intention of those who erected them: Deterrence.

One can only imagine what treasure required such immense defense.
