Ghosts procreating is probably the strangest thing you'll never see. I'm sure you thought death was random, but no, it's the result of a couple of ghosts getting frisky. I'd describe it to you in more detail but I'm afraid of titillating some nearby phantoms. And I don't want to be responsible for killing anyone.
