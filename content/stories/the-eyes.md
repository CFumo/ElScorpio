“Have you felt the pain yet?” The young girl whispered conspiratorially to her equally young friend. Both girls wore their hair in simple pigtails. The friend shook hers violently.

“Well I have,” she said with a smirk. “It feels like being broken from the inside.”

Her friend’s eyes opened wide, as only child’s eyes can do, eyes opened wide with shock, “Really?”

“What are you two whispering about over here?” Snapped the cranky old teacher. Her joints creaked with each move, her eyes, small and sharp, missed very little.

“Nothing teacher,” the girl looked up innocently.

“She feels pain, the pain. The terrible pain,” her friend blurted before she could stop herself.

For the first time in years the teachers eyes opened with the kind of shock reserved for the young, “Oh can she? Come with me girl.” Roughly she pulled the girl up by her bare arm.

The old teacher dragged the girl through many, many rooms. Some rooms held other children whose inquisitive faces pressed against the rooms small windows. Others were empty, neat little beds all ready for the newest occupants. They went to the restricted corridor, the one constantly locked against the childish curiosity that resided in this place.

“Madam,” the teacher announced her presence to the woman in a stiff blue dress.  At this point the young girl started to wiggle in her capturers hand, she was bored. Tired of the game that resulted in nothing at all exciting. Just more rooms. Just more aged adults.

“Isadora,” the woman in blue answered.

“She feels it. She feels the pain."

The woman broke out in a smile, “Does she? I knew someone would admit to it eventually. You may go.”

Isadora left the rich room swiftly, locking the young girl in before she could protest.

“Name?”

The girl glared up at the woman, “Don’t you know that already?”

“Spunky. Name. Now.”

The girl rolled her eyes. She was already too vocal, too mouthy for her age, “Adelaide.”

“What sort of pain do you feel?”

“Stabbing mostly.”

Madam nodded, “Yes… and do you know why?”

She shrugged.

“Come, come Adelaide. Do you know why?”

“I know the rumors.”

Madam smiled. Leave it to children to spread the lies they were too innocent to question. “And what are those?”

“That it’s a simple pain, that our body simply hurts,” She paused than added the most outrageous lie, “or that it means the ones who abandoned us are dying.”  Again a sneer crossed Madam’s lips. “But I don’t believe it,” Adelaide’s bright hazel eyes glared up at Madam’s. Madam was shocked to read the harshness in them, there was no doe-eyed trust left.

“Why?”

“I see things…” for the first time she faltered, “When it happens. Flashes of-” a sharp stab broke through her words, but not really a stab. The feeling of a hatchet, crashing down. Breaking. She gasped. The room melted away. She was standing in a rain soaked alley. She was looking at herself in a floor length green dress. Her hair was no longer in pigtails. But it was her eyes that shocked her, that made her unrecognizable. They were a dark black. Blood started trickling down from her scalp. Men in suits surrounded her body, which was starting to crumble to the ground.

In a second she snapped back to the rich room, to the woman in blue.

“My, my, the lies we tell ourselves.” Madam whispered, a little too breathlessly.

Adelaide stared defiantly at Madam. A small impulse told her to fight back against the words, at the accusation that she was pretending in any way. She ignored it. The feeling to stay silent was stronger.

“Lost your bite?”

She shook her head.

“What is it Miss Adelaide?”

“This is why you kept us kids around, why you take in orphans,” She didn’t wait for a confirmation. She could see in Madam’s expression that it was true, “How do you choose?”

Madam raised an eyebrow. She’d seen many a young child come through, but none were quite so developed as Adelaide. They usually had questions, their eyes were expressive, and they never had the flashes. “You’ve kept this quiet for some time.”

Adelaide nodded. Madam sat down in her high backed chair. She regarded the girl, started wondering how far along she really was.

It was a quick shift, probably not even noticeable to those not trained. A flash. A sharp pain somewhere near her heart. A pool of blood developing, Adelaide’s eyes small, harsh and black.

A hand reached out somewhere very far away.  In a moment Madam found herself in a small white room. A man stood next to her, he beamed down. She found in her arms a little girl.

“We’ll name her Adelaide.”

A hand reached out somewhere very far away.  In a moment Madam found herself on all fours. She was on a playground, her hair in two pig tails, and her crystal grey eyes were wide with shock. She looked up to see a woman pulling her up, taking her through many, many rooms. Some rooms held other children whose inquisitive faces pressed against the rooms small windows. Others were empty, neat little beds all ready for the newest occupants. They went to the restricted corridor, the one constantly locked against the childish curiosity that resided in this place.
