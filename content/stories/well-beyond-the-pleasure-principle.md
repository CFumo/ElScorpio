*Prompt:*

*"Pig on the other side of a glory hole." - Felix Alonso*

Dr. Freud’s office door swung open and Cosmo strutted in, smiling.

“What’s up Dr. Freud!”

Freud laid his face on his desk and groaned.

“Now what is it Cosmo.”

“Look man, I don’t mean to intrude on your … self. But these meetings have just been so helpful for my writing…”

Freud made a dissenting grunt.

“It is my opinion,” he began—still face-down on his desk—“that your insistence on meeting with me is a result of repressed feelings of insecurity about your writing, perhaps owing to your relationship with your mother as…”

“No, haha, no way man,” Cosmo interrupted, “this isn’t that. It’s just… it helps me think of creative ways to tell some of these stories, y’know?”

Dr. Freud sat up and gazed forlornly out at the park across the street.

“If this is what you want, it appears I have no choice.”

“Dude, it’ll be fun! This time we’re going on a field trip.”

“We both know this joke will not be funny twice,” said Freud, reluctantly grabbing his coat and heading to the door.

“Haha, whatever man,” said Cosmo. “I think people liked you enough to warrant *one *more visit.“ He waited for Freud to pass through the door and slapped the doctor’s butt before following him out.

“WHAT DID YOU CALL THIS FORM OF MUSIC?” Dr. Freud yelled in Cosmo’s ear as a mass of neon bodies bounced and gyrated all around them.

“IT’S CALLED TRANCE, IT’S MADE ELECTRONICALLY. HERE, SNORT THIS.”

Cosmo poured a small vial of white powder onto his hand. Freud—still mesmerized by the pulsating mass of mostly-undressed bodies pressing against him—pulled the hand to his face and snorted. He tried gyrating his hips like the woman next to him but found the movements foreign and confusing.

“IT IS A BIT LOUD, BUT QUITE ENJOYABLE! WHEN WILL THIS TRANCE MUSIC BE INVENTED?”

“I KNOW RIGHT!” said Cosmo, scanning the strobing auditorium and clearly ignoring the doctor. “HERE, FOLLOW ME.”

Cosmo brushed his hand along Dr. Freud’s chest and then pulled him through the crowd. He traced a winding path, weaving between impassable clumps of ravers and periodically looking back over his shoulder with a seductive grin. Freud, meanwhile, was feeling a growing sense of euphoria. He reached out and swept his hand along the throng of dancers and felt the soft flesh of their bodies. He wondered absently if the sensory stimulus would fully overwhelm his conscious mind and revert him to a state of pure id. That would be fun.

After pushing through the mess of lasers and marijuana for some time the pair eventually arrived at what appeared to be a bathroom, although Freud had never seen a bathroom as unsanitary is this. Cosmo showed the doctor into a stall in the corner of the men’s room and pointed at a small asymmetrical hole in the wall.

“Y’see that hole there? That’s called a ‘gloryhole’.” Cosmo made an air-quote gesture with his hands but Freud didn’t notice. “You… uhh… you can put your dick in it and somebody on the other side might give you oral … stimulation.”

Freud’s eyes lit up with excitement. His id *was* taking over tonight.

“With a stranger?”

“Yeah, or… yeah.”

Freud wasted no time in unbuttoning his trousers and undergarments. He leaned up against the wall and felt his fingers stick to its irregular surface. He made a sharp, nervous exhalation as he let himself into the gloryhole.

A few moments passed in relative silence. Cosmo massaged Dr. Freud’s shoulders and whispered something about a farm that Freud didn’t quite catch. He was too busy feeling the massage and the crisp air on the other side of the gloryhole. He had never had a better massage or touched a stickier wall in his life. It was miraculous.

And then he felt something. A slight tickle on the end of his member. And then another. And then… pure ecstasy. The anonymous mouth grunted and took him in fully; its tongue caressing his shaft from base to tip and undulating slowly. He pressed his hips harder against the wall, pushing as much of himself through the gloryhole as he possibly could. The feeling that this mouth could produce was nothing short of extraordinary. The tongue slurped and fluttered along the tip of his penis and back down his shaft. His knees momentarily buckled and he might have fallen away from the gloryhole if not for the sticky wall which slowed his fall enough for him regain balance. The mouth grunted again and started working faster; sucking and sliding along his throbbing manhood with a chaotic kind of elegance.

Freud wished he could see through the wall. He wished he could reach across the threshold and caress the beautiful person who did this for him. But he understood the importance of anonymity in such a debaucherous exercise as this. He would not compromise the integrity of the gloryhole, not when it was capable of producing the kind of rapturous emotion that he was presently feeling.

The mouth pulled away from him, snorted, and then sneezed.

“Gesundheit,” said the doctor, reflexively.

A pig squealed somewhere near the other side of the gloryhole, then the stranger’s mouth once again closed around him and began sucking.

“Excuse me for speaking during this most climactic moment of passion, o beautiful muse,” began Dr. Freud, “but do you perchance have an animal with you in the stall?”

Cosmo started speaking again but the words were muffled and didn’t make sense. What did he mean about there being “only” a pig? Was it common to bring multiple farm animals into the bathroom at these trance music concerts? Freud pushed harder against the gloryhole, hoping he hadn’t killed the mood with his questioning before the beautiful mouth could finish what it had started.

“A pig is sucking your dick,” said Cosmo.

Freud sighed, gave Cosmo an angry look, and then let the pig finish.
