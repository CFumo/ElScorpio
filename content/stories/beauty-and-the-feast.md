After the spell was broken, Beauty and the Prince were married and lived happily for a time. But something was missing. Though the Prince was handsome, Beauty found that she missed the luxurious fur and the rough low voice of the Beast. The Prince for his part missed the preternatural strength and speed that came with his other form. And of course, they both missed the snug fit of his monster cock in her slight frame.

They consulted the local dark wizard to see if the Prince could be changed back.

“It’s possible,” said the Wizard, “but the change must follow an act of great evil. You have learned too well the value of love and kindness, so we’ll have to undo all that hard work.”

Following the instructions of an ancient tome in the Wizard’s library, the three organized a ritual atrocity of exceedingly vile proportions. The Prince invited every member of the town to a masquerade ball in honor of the anniversary of his transformation. At the stroke of midnight all but one of the doors to the crowded ballroom were locked and chained from the outside. Beauty and the Prince—now covered in heavy layers of plated armor—entered the ballroom from the only remaining unlocked door and began assaulting guests with heavy steel longswords. As the mob of increasingly terrified townsfolk pressed toward the doorway, those who were not slain by the sword were trampled and suffocated in a heaving, screaming mass of panicked party guests. The massacre lasted for nearly an hour. The last of the townsfolk were found hiding among their butchered families and were executed mercilessly.

When the perpetrators of the slaughter were finally alone among the dead, the Prince removed his armor and began to brutishly hack out the heart of each victim and squeeze its blood into his mouth. With each passing sacrifice the Prince’s bloodlust increased and his actions became more erratic. Upon consuming the foul blood of his fortieth victim the Prince had fulfilled the requirements for his ritual and was beginning to transform, but his rage would not acquiesce. He gripped the bleeding torso of another fallen guest and began clawing at it; digging toward the heart.

“No, you fool!” screamed the Wizard. “You must not consume another heart! You will initiate a much more diabolical ritual!”

The Beast could no longer hear the Wizard’s pleas, or perhaps the words were meaningless to him. He tore his victim’s heart out of the chest to which it belonged and forced it down his throat in its entirety. Beauty, transfixed by the profane actions of her lover, vaguely overheard the Wizard screaming “...tear a hole in spacetime!” before a thunderous black portal ripped into existence and completely incinerated the ballroom.

Beauty and the Beast were sucked into the screaming darkness of the portal and flung into the incomprehensibly distant future. The accelerated expansion of the universe resulted in a reality in which all spaces were inconceivably vast and geometry was meaningless. Biological life was no longer possible, but life went on in the form of scattered individual consciousnesses, voidbound, blinded, and impossibly lonely. For these beings, the speed of thought was slowed to a dismal sisyphean crawl, and they spent millennia consumed by the inescapable dread of their continued existences. Beauty and the Beast were immediately annihilated into a single slow-swirling maelstrom of eternal self-loathing and sexual frustration.
