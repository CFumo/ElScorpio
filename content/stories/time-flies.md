A fly popped into existence with a radiating blue glow and crackling sound. It landed on Cosmo's keyboard. "Hey, I'm trying to work here," he said swatting at it. It disappeared with a radiating blue glow and crackling sound. "Huh," breathed Cosmo who decided right then to take a break and have some fresh air despite slower than usual progress on the internal exporter flow challenge function.

He paced along the empty apartment. He was sure it was just fatigue. The problem was he had slept very well, and was not feeling particularly stressed out. Nothing felt off. Two flies appeared on the balcony while he stared into the blue sky, making sense of the situation. They landed simultaneously on his arm, which he instinctively swatted at. He caught a bright blue glow out of the corner of his eye and definitely heard crackling noises. But he hadn't seen the flies, so he couldn't confirm his now reasonable suspicions. Maybe he wasn't going insane after all. Flies just disappear with a flash and a bang now. Maybe he was going insane after all.

Cosmo decided on a nap. The work could wait an hour. He drew the curtains, set the alarm for 2:15 PM, laid down and shut his eyes. He awoke an hour later to the alarm. He could hear buzzing in the room. A fly was flirting with a light fixture. He turned the light on and the fly began repeated and heroic efforts to merge with the fixture, to no avail. It had some buddies. A couple of them were leisurely scaling the wall. One explored the keyboard of his laptop.

Cosmo considered the improbability of them having come into a closed room. But then again, they are common houseflies. They could probably get in anywhere. He sat up and moved over to his desk and sat into the chair while observing the fly on the keyboard carefully. It was nothing out of the ordinary. He brought a hand up and slowly let it hover over the fly. He slammed it down, resulting in a blue glow, fairly loud crackling noise, a keyboard void of a dead fly and a line of code reading "class Index(objectdfgr)".

Correcting the code, while eyeing the other flies, he stood up and regarded the leisurely flies on the wall. They appeared identical. All houseflies appear identical. He tried to study them in detail. The wings did have the same pattern. Do all houseflies have the same pattern on their wings? A small crease on the left wing was identical. That couldn't be a simple coincidence. Could it? It probably could. But it was the strongest case he had. The ... the strongest case for what? These two flies are the same fly? That didn't exactly alleviate Cosmo's ever creeping doubt over his own sanity. His imagination couldn't even make flies with distinguishing features.

He swatted at them and they disappeared in the way they had before. Cosmo sat and thought. "I should call someone," he considered. He sat and thought, when a fly made a flashy appearance on the keyboard. He looked at it. The fly did not seem bothered. It prepared for flight. Cosmo sat with rapt attention. It flew to join its buddy on the light fixture.

They walked along it for a little while, when one of them suddenly curled up and fell. Cosmo surmised it had died. He was correct. Then there was more than one fly. He was incorrect. He swatted at the remaining fly, which made a flashy departure. Cosmo never spoke of the incident with these strange flies with anyone.
