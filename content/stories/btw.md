Midnight.

The deep dead of night was the only time that Batman felt truly comfortable. Felt that he could be his true self. No judgment. No expectations. No pressure to wear the Bruce Wayne mask. No clawing suffocating gazes of shallow socialites. No Alfred. Nothing. Just him. Just him and the bat.

Right now, in this world, there were more than the ordinary reasons for preferring the night. The light of the morning would bring the ever present gaze of the sun. And The Joker's Nightmare would give anything to evade that accusing gaze for as long as he could. Gotham’s Prince planned to be long gone by the time the sun came up.

Batman stood in a shallow valley. He knew from past experience that the valley would be lush green in the daylight. He’d only seen that once and had no intention of repeating that experience. The Caped Canaveral carefully picked his way through the valley, his goal a small mound at the valley’s center. To the casual observer, it would appear no different from any other hill. But Batsy knew better, and as he drew near, the mound’s peculiarities began to emerge.

Aligned with each of the cardinal directions ornately engraved glass semicircles were inset into the mound’s side. Batman continued circling around to the southern side of the mound where he could make out a domed entrance. He slowly approached and using the keycard he’d received on his first visit he opened the door and stole inside.

The interior was dark and still. The only sound came from a cleaning contraption gently buzzing in the corner. The Dark Knight stealthily crept through the interior to one of 4 identical doors. With bated breath The Bat-Themed Superhero gripped the handle, steeled himself for just a moment, and slipped inside.

As he eased the door shut, a curvy figure rolled over in their bed, “Is that you B?”

“Yes.” The Caped Crusader answered in a deep gravely voice, “I come for you.”

“You’ve… ‘cum’... for me?”

Gotham’s most eligible bachelor ripped the sheets away to reveal the nude form of Tinky Winky. Purple flesh quivered as The Aristocrat Vigilante leaned down to gently nibble the tubby’s ear. Leaving his head nuzzled in Tinky’s neck, Batman reached down, unzipped his bat-fly, and allowed his veiny bat-dong to fall against Tinky’s jolly mounds.

Tinky Winky gasped as the Nighttime Neerdowell gently but forcefully guided himself between the luscious purple folds. As he thrust, Batman found Tinky’s throbbing member and slowly worked it in his gloved hand.

As the pace of their passion quickened, Tinky’s Tubby-vision flickered to life. Within his lover’s glowing rectangle Batman could make out the debache scenes of their previous tryst. Last time had been particularly rough. He watched himself, belt tight around his neck as his past self rode Tinky’s engorged manhood. His image on Tinky’s tummy vigorously bounced and began slapping the purple Tubby while masturbating furiously.

It was like this, in a room dimly lit by the television implanted in the stomach of a grotesque purple children’s entertainer that Gotham’s Greatest Detective spent his seed deep within the inner folds of that self-same kiddie icon.

As he came, the Tubby-vision winked out and Batman collapsed upon his plump purple lover.

“Again! Again!” The lusty tubby demanded.

“Tinky,” The spent knight rasped, “How long can this deception go on?”

“Again! Again!” The sex crazed purple demon demanded as he forcefully guided Batman’s head to his throbbing purple shaft. With a sigh of mingled resignation and desire, the Hero Gotham Deserves greedily complied.
