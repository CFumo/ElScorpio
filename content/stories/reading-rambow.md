"But then what happened, Grandpa?" asked Timmy in a tremulous voice.

Timmy and Tommy were tucked in bed while Grandpa Ted recounted the reckless tale of Rambow the Revenant.

"'Revenant' is a metaphor, kids," said Ted. "For how completely shittin' off-the-rocker hamster-wheel-runnin' insane he was!"

"Jesus, Grandpa, how many guns did he have?" asked Tommy.

"Wow. A lot. Like, really a lot, of guns," said Ted.

Tommy's eyes lit up like little lazer beams, but Timmy trembled and whimpered beside him.

"You guys wanna hear about the headband again?" asked Grandpa, nodding eagerly. A little bit of spit-drool pooled at the corner of his limp mouth.

"Yeah!!" said Tommy.

"Nonononononononono," said Timmy. His eyes were titanic with terror.

"It was blood. Red. And, it's, holding back his bulging forehead veins. And it's like—" He waved his arms wildly, "—*soaked *with sweat."

"But it was *cool *sweat, right Grandad?"

"Oh sure! The coolest sweat you ever saw!"

"*Impossible*," Timmy muttered venomously.

"So he's got his headband on, and like, all his guns, right? But like, because he's holding his guns, his arms— his biceps are… bulging like *crazy*."

Tommy wiggled a little in his seat.

"There's, there's sweat all over his arms too. Just, dripping off, and flying everywhere cause he's running. He's running—" Grandpa paused, looking around wildly, "—to the action."

"Dear god…" whispered Timmy. He felt the cold claws of horror and fascination creep up his back.

Rambow looked around wildly. Where was the *action*? There was, like, gunfire in the distance, all around him.

"Hwuhh!" he said, eyes wide and confused. He clutched all of his guns to his chest, cause he was afraid, he didn't know where the action was. He kept running. Sweat was flying off of him. And also, he wasn't wearing a shirt, but his chest was so hairy, it was like he didn't even need one.

So he started running faster, right? Bare arms glistening. There was sweat on the guns too. It was like the guns were sweating, but they weren't. They were so beautiful. He clutched them to his chest. To protect them.

"Don't worry Timmy, Tommy, I gotcha," he muttered under his breath, comforting the guns. They were so scared.

The forest was getting darker, and creepier. Home stretch. He had to find the action. It sounded so close. Where were the *choppers*?

A tree root whipped out like an evil hand and grabbed his ankle. And he just went flying, cause he was running so fast. The guns went flying, but in different directions.

"No!" he wheezed. The guns! There was sweat falling into his eyes. Where was his headband? He clawed at the ground, but the guns were too far away, but he couldn't see where they were because the sweat was in his eyes. All he came up with was handfuls of dirt. He clutched them to his chest. He curled in on himself, knees to his stomach, clutching the dirt. The sound of gunfire grew fainter. It wasn't even worth getting back up.

But then, like, he suddenly realized. He gasped. He *was *the action.
