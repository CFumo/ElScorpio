KING CLAUDIUS

Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!

Moreover that we much did long for you,

The need we have to use you did provoke

Our hasty sending. Something have you heard

Of Hamlet's excitation; so call it,

Sith as the exterior so the inward man

Does tremble with new lust. What it should be,

More than his father's death, that put him thus

So frantic and resolved to spend his seed,

I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,

That, being of so young days abed with him,

And sith so neighbour'd to his appetites,

That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court

Some little time: so by your tender touch

To draw him on all pleasures of the flesh,

And when his lips are loosened you may glean,

If aught, to us unknown, inflames him thus,

That, open'd, lies within our remedy.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

Good gentlemen, he hath much bragged of you;

And sure I am two men there are not living

Who're blessed with longer cocks. If it will please you

To show us both your oft bespoken rods

So we may judge your value to our son,

And once confirmed that he's been gaily wrecked,

You'll both receive an emperor's worth of thanks;

The prize for promiscuity is great.

ROSENCRANTZ

Both your majesties must surely know

I long for nothing but to run my tongue,

In languid careful circles, soft and slow,

Around the puckered anus of your son.

GUILDENSTERN

When do we get to fuck
