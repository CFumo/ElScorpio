"Delivery!" called a voice from the hallway, and a knock sounded at the door. I quietly powered on my impulse pistol, pointed it into the peephole, and called back: "Delivery for who?" I could feel the blood pounding in my ears, since as far as I knew, I hadn't ordered anything... unless it had happened again. He told me the label read, "To Mr. T. H. Johnson, from Allen's Data Emporium, love Mom;" and I tucked the weapon under my jacket into the back of my waist band. Right as I opened the door, the squat delivery man threw the package into my arms and left, yelling "Sorry!" as he turned the corner. I later discovered the wrappings of the package gave me syphilis, and the delivery man was not sorry.

Finally free from the curse of healthfulness, Trombone Horace "Uncle Andy Johnson" Johnson wept and slowly ate the package.
