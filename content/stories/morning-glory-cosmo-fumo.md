The mood was right.

Driving beats from Black Alligator’s Incest Princess entranced the piece of toast and excited the stick of butter. Harvest Wheat arched her crust at Sweet Cream, yearning for his touch. To have heard of the legendary canola oil of Belarus for years and finally seeing it- a true wonderland of experience.

“Sweet Cream. How splendid that name sounds,” she murmured.

“It’s not the only thing that’s splendid. Try rubbing my stick.”

She rubbed Sweet Cream’s stick.

“YES! YES! YES!”

“Nice.”

Their bodies, connected by fermented milk, quivered. Harvest Wheat loved being one with Sweet Cream. She fantasized about sharing a single body with him. Spreading as one, cooking as one, shitting as one. Harvest Wheat felt an emotion greater than anything she had felt before. Was it love? Surely not- Sweet Cream was out of her social class and the union would not last.

“Wanna go fuck up the bagels?” Her reverie interrupted by his flawless voice.

“No!”

“Then roll onto your burnt side.”

And so she did. Hours passed in sexual ecstasy. When Harvest Wheat thought she could take no more, something surprising happened!

“I have to tell you an embarrassing secret. I am half-margarine.”

Every motion stopped. Did she hear Sweet Cream right? Was he truly a reduced-dairy product?

“I can’t believe that!”

He laughed, “I knew you would say that.”

“That isn’t what-”

His lips were blocked with her wheat.

A powerful orgasm wracked his body. He felt blissfully warm and started melting.
