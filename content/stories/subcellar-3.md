In Danya's neighborhood there was an abandoned house which frequently emitted weird sounds and fairy lights, according to the local boys. One night Danya entered the creepy building through a basement window. The basement was empty, except for a ring of whitecapped mushrooms growing in the center of the earthen floor. Danya tried the handle of the door leading upstairs, and found it unlocked. But when he opened the door, he saw that the stairs led down, not up. Was there a second basement? As he hesitated on the landing, looking down into the dark stairwell, the door slammed shut behind him. In a panic he jiggled the handle and shouldered the door, but it wouldn't budge. He had no choice but to descend.

The stairs opened into the smoky interior of a little wooden hut. Strings of herbs hung in bunches from the ceiling, and a wrinkled old woman stood stirring the contents of a bubbling cauldron.

"Hello Grandmother," said Danya.

"And how did you get in here, young man?" asked the old woman.

"I came down the stairs. Onlyâ€¦I wouldn't have, but the door slammed shut behind me."

"You'll have to get the key from the Devil's old mother. Take this spade and dig a hole in that mound of earth there."

She handed Danya a little iron spade with a wooden handle. Danya turned and saw a large mound of earth in the corner of the hut, which he dug through until he broke into a large hole. Down he tumbled through the black, until he emerged at the rumpled base of an oak tree. The oak stood in a graveyard full of old crosses and imposing headstones.

At the far end of the graveyard, Danya found a group of fey ladies dancing and reveling in the moonlight. There were sea maidens with caramel skin and dripping green hair; and snow maidens with pale skin and blue hair strung with icicles; and witches with green skin and hair as black as pitch. They laughed and caroused, drinking fairy wine and eating strange fruits.

Come dance with us, they said to Danya, but he declined. Have something to eat, they said, but he refused. Drink of the fairy wine, they said, but Danya would not open his lips.

Finally they gave him an old lever handle and directed him out the graveyard gate, down the road and past the millpond, to where an old-fashioned cage elevator stood by itself. It was wrought iron with intricate floral designs, and fronted by the bust of Baphomet in bas relief. Danya climbed inside, fitted the handle, and sent the elevator down into the earth.

When the elevator shuddered to a halt, Danya stepped into the dimly-lit hallway of a highrise apartment. Cooking smells and disquieting, far-off sounds floated to him. One door in the hallway stood open, and Danya slipped inside. An old woman sat in a rocking chair in the corner. She put her finger to her lips.

"Shhh."

Danya heard the Devil arguing loudly on the phone in the other room. Bright kitchen light spilled through the doorway and onto the living room wall, and in the light Danya saw the Devil's shadow, gesticulating imperiously, pointed tail whipping back and fourth.

The old woman beckoned with one finger. Danya crept across the room to her, and she handed him a tiny silver key. Danya left as quietly as he could, but at the threshold the door creaked loudly beside him. The Devil was suddenly towering in the doorway to the kitchen.

"You," He screeched, pointing, and Danya caught one look at His horrible red face before he fled. He ran back through the hallway, then back across the graveyard, then back through the witch's hut. At the top of the stairs, he fumbled with the key and lock even as he heard the Devil racing after him. He just made it through the door in time to slam it on the Devil's red fingers, the tips of which fell twitching to the floor of the basement.

Danya left the old house and did not look back, and in time he forgot about his adventure underground. Except for those times when, sitting alone, he would be gripped by a sudden unease. He had escaped with his life, but after seeing the Devil's face, he never quite recovered his soul.
