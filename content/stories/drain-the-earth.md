Set out prospecting last. Yep. Saw the seam. Looked good. Vascular, almost. I’m a simple man with a simple story and I don’t have fancy tools. So I started the gash with a good old trench digger. Little by little, they say. I don’t fancy myself a follower, so I do the whole vein with one pass. Gonna be cutting away the same amount anyway. Why not pace back and forth while I’m at it. Less boring.

Got to the point where I started hitting mud. Earth’s blood welling between layers of the white and pink rock. Done this a hundred times. Scares some of the greenthumbs. Think they’ve gone too deep. No no. There’s a lot this crust hides. Certainly a lot more than the pittance THEY are happy with finding.

Now, as I said, I’m a simple man. With that comes the simple understanding that after my little girl and boy got in the accident, I stopped having much to live for. Not even more little ones to have with Juniper. Died during childbirth of our second. Many do- I suppose I should be thankful to God about our first not being a problem.

So now, I can go deeper than most. What with their inhibitions of safety and the concern for their loved ones- they can’t have the attitude that I have. I’m free, I reckon. So I dig deeper.

Reached more of the white stone. Spongy stuff. The more I furrowed the surface, the farther the red stone moved, as if repulsed by big old magnets. I walked off after a few runs- after the real paydirt started to get uncovered. Had to clean my tools and wash out the gash. I know, I know- why waste all the product? Like someone said, you gotta spend money to make money. And I know that the enormous amount of fluid was paltry in comparison to what is truly deep inside. Just requires more work. And more danger.

Got back into the seam after letting the drying towels do most of their job. Started cutting. Consistency is key, you see. Can’t cut willy-nilly. It’s real easy when you can see the seam, but when the stuff starts coming, all you’ve got to go on is intuition and luck.

A breach in a larger vein almost swept me away then and there- nicked something good and the sides parted like the Red Sea for Moses. Got out of the hole after a bit of a panic. Even for a man with nothing to lose, there’s a reptile brain trying to keep the machinery running. Or so I think anyway.

I didn’t mention it before, but there was a second vein that I was going after during the drying breaks of the first one. Smaller, but it still bulged with promise. While letting the torrent run off, I shook myself off like some sort of hound-dog and went back to the second furrow. Must have had a case of nervous shakes from that near accident because I did the exact same thing to this wound in the Earth. No spouting of the precious essence, but it sure expanded quickly.

That didn’t sit well with me. My digger hadn’t been sharpened by the smithy in a while and to do the really fine, dangerous work, you need a keen tool. Perhaps next time. At least I’d collected enough to be sanguine for a while longer.
