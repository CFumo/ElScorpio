Marriage was the trap. Melissa learned that the hard way. When she first met Abby, it was all hand-holding and deep longing gazes. Their first kiss was on a chilly afternoon after a walk in the park. They took off their scarves, paused in the foyer, and locked lips quickly and quietly. Abby divulged a small smile before pulling Melissa into the kitchen to make dinner. They married six months later, still high on early love. Friends and family were not so surprised as they made a lovely match.

Then, one day only weeks later Melissa came home to find an envelope on the kitchen table. Enclosed was a letter in Abby's scrawl and a copy of their marriage contract. She sat down and held the letter in both hands. The tension in her shoulders mounting as she read:

*My lovely Melissa, *

*You will never forgive me this transgression but I must inform you now that we will never see each other again. I am off to live my remainder in repentant solitude and never again think of winning another’s hand. I have enjoyed your company over the passing months and have preferred it to many others’. I will not wound you further by submitting that I had loved you. This is a thing that I have been unable to say in truth to any man or woman in many decades. Instead I will explain the great curse that has bound me and now binds you. *

*I married a man for the first time one hundred fourteen years ago. He courted me in the same passionate and earnest manner, which I pursued you. I was similarly blinded and made dumb by the wild delight of youthful optimism. Soon after our wedding I too was greeted by an empty home and placating script. I learned that the rest of my life was to be blighted by the search for false love and credible affection, that this accursed life would extend beyond its natural bounds to fulfill a dark and heinous purpose. When you marked your name on the pledge of fidelity before you, your fate was circumscribed in the same way. *

*If you read our matrimonial text carefully, you will find outlined within its contents the details of our union, damning and cruel. By entering into our scribal and spiritual merger, you joined your soul with the Lord Devil and your eternity became lashed to the depths of Hades, unless you fulfill the requirements of the agreement signed. As you will read in the document, you must pass this curse on to others until forty times the worth of your soul has been committed to damnation. It is a grave consequence: so innocent and virtuous are you. Indeed, your soul shines like diamonds to the heavens and the depths. It pains me to have chained such a noble spirit to such villainous work, but my scruples have changed and the prize of freedom from this life and Hades' grasp was too tempting to neglect. So I have been given liberty at the cost of your enslavement. My soul once shone as yours does, prolonging my servitude. Thus, in appreciation for suffering still to come, I will leave you with some final guiding words: do not waste years on the indecent and corrupted; instead, seek the pure of heart and bring them joy until you are both committed by darkness. This will end the torment in haste. *

*Your first wife, Abigail*
