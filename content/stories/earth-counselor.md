Coarse pebbles shook and swirled around Patya’s head. Her impatience held them in orbit with crushing intensity. At any moment, they threatened to zing across the room if she thought too hard. She rocked steadily back and forth on the wooden bench in the tiny hallway, doing dips and wall sits to soothe herself.

“What is taking so long? This needs to be over with already.” Patya gritted her teeth.

As if on cue, the heavy oaken door swung open. She leapt up and forced herself to walk toward the doorway. Her hemp-soled shoes made no sound on the gravel floor. Her stride slowed when the room appeared dark and cavernous. But there was no time to wonder. One step across the threshold, she was attacked. A grapefruit-sized rock flew straight at Patya’s right ear with a fist close behind. She dropped her stance just in time as the blow passed over and through her dark hair, narrowly missing its target.

This was a surprise. She thought they were going to talk.

Preparing for another attack, Patya deepened her crouch. Her opponent withdrew slightly. His eyes flashed as he shot off a volley of punches and accompanying stones. She unfurled her body, sweeping her right leg in a wide half-circle, toes brushing the ground as the earth erupted upward along a matching curve in front of her. The shield held off five quick bursts, giving her enough time to pull up two mounds with a set of short upper cuts. She focused on protecting her upper body as she stepped back into the open. Her bracers rose and fell slightly in the air with her heavy breathing.

“Good morning, Ms. Bainasu. I’m glad you made it.” The tall, cloaked man had assumed a neutral pose.

Patya narrowed her eyes, confused. “Am I in the counseling office?” She struggled to comprehend the situation and simply observed his thin face and calm demeanor instead.

He smiled pleasantly and came around her protecting wall to offer a handshake. “Yes. I am Counselor Tuk. It’s lovely to meet you. I’ve heard so much.”

The two floating rocks dropped hesitantly as Patya released the tension in her arms and back to accept the greeting. “Hi.” She paused and looked around at the sparse therapy office. “Um, what’s going on?”

“Oh, I just thought you could use a little loosening up. And sparring engages the body and the mind. I could feel your heartbeat from down the hall!” He chuckled and ushered her into a soft, comfy chair across from a small desk. “Now the dean tells me you’ve been waiting for an appointment for a little while, and I’m so sorry about that, there are a lot of students scheduling these days. Almost midterms, you know?”

“Uh-huh.”

“Now I know this is just a part of your probational acceptance agreement, but why not make it meaningful, right? We can spend this time however you like. So, is there anything that you’d like to talk about?”

Patya stared, dumbfounded. She was convinced she had met the strangest therapist ever.
