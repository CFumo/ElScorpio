Heaving Void was a rotund unicorn with splotchy fur and a crusty yellow mane. It was dusk in the human world, and she would have to stagger home soon, but she thought she had time for one more drink. She breathed in the air with a wheeze as she drifted through the neon light of the grimy streets. Shrinking down to the size of a rat, she found the entrance to a possum's nest and crept inside. Deep in the dwelling, two possums were smoking together at a make-shift bar. An extra hole had been poked in one of the walls, and the fumes rolled out in curling, petulant shapes. Heaving Void scraped at an itch on her side. Then she waved her horn and a single gold coin appeared, which she tossed beside the possums. She left them in silence and took a vodka soda to go.

Sated, she floated home on the undulating smog. The Land of Unicorns existed in a state of perpetual twilight. Stars peaked through the purple sky while the summer sun glowed low on the horizon, and the twin rainbow moons were visible at their zenith. Heaving Void headed to the outskirts and landed in the Enchanted Rose Ghetto, where she found her two friends, Anodyne and Hollow Star. They were whispering and coughing as they careened between the rows of sweet-smelling garbage.

"Hi Heaving Void," said Hollow Star. "Have you heard the news? The summer strain is hitting the block this week!"

"Shit, I hadn't heard!" said Heaving Void. She shuttered with anticipation.

"Also," said Anodyne in her soft voice, "Crystal Sex is looking for you. I think she's still in The Garden."

The unicorns parted ways, and Heaving Void went to look for Crystal Sex. She didn't mind the walk. The Garden was lovely, overflowing with drunken nubile ponies in a variety of colors. The whinnies of intimacy and the pounding of the techno played over the sound of the evening breeze.

"There you are!" called Crystal Sex. "You're back just in time! Your bitch is about to foal!"

Heaving Void closed her eyes and neighed ruefully. She was going to be a mother. Held up by Crystal Sex, she stumbled back to her stable where her mate, Eternal Nightmare, was in labor. Eternal Nightmare gave birth to two tiny, adorable baby unicorns. Their mothers named them Blackened Horror and Existential Dread.
