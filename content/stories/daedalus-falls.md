"Do what you want, 'cause a pirate is free, you are a pirate."

–Robbie Rotten on Man's duty to exploit bestowed freedoms.

LazyTown, c. 2004

A needle bored through space at near lightspeed. Its three zeta-pinched tokamak-driven picosecond laser-pulsed muon catalyzed hydrogen-boron pure thermonuclear fusion engines hummed quite happily to give the 5 metric gigatons vessel the 1.5 G acceleration needed to keep the small crew grounded and their flight time over 4.87 parsecs to within a tolerable range of just over 4 years one-way.

The vessel had just started deceleration at the mid-way point about exactly between Sol and Groombridge when screens in mission control showed a ship approaching from bow, settling starboard. It bore the name 'Satisfaction'. The United States flag shone through cracked black paint. They had been followed from Sol.

"I told them. I told them. Didn't I tell them? I fucking told them this would happen! Now they'll just waltz right in!" Captain Lahi "Parsley" Tomlin raged.

Indeed, at the planning phase, design phase and even during construction of Daedalus, Cpt. Tomlin had voiced the opinion that the ship was vulnerable to intrusion if there were no, ahem... guns... on board the starship and no missile defense system or at the very least a measly laser cannon mounted somewhere on the hull.

The International Society of Engineers did carefully discuss the option to integrate defensive capabilities on numerous occasions. The Planning Committee, Board of Design and the House of Engineering all reached similar conclusions. Weaponry would be an expensive option which could jeopardize the mission by adding unnecessary complexity. The risk profile is highest as it nears Groombridge and its speed drops. But Groombridge system is already secured, so the only possible risk they saw was—laughably—aliens. Basically, no risk.

Captain Henry Morgan cackled loudly. This was going to be the easiest job yet! "Sir, when you're done laughing like a maniac, I'd like it if we carried out the strike before they have a chance to mount a defense."

"Defence!? My darling Ramine! They have none! Don't you see? It will be the easiest job in all of history! Dearest wench, we'll be rich!"

"Don't count your–" "Aye, but the bump is behind us. Two years of waiting in this dingy is paying out somethin' fierce."

"I'll see it–" "Oh come off it and let's rejoice-as soon as we're in, there ain't none and nothin' comin' between us and the loot."

"It's best to strike–" "My sweetest young thing, they're not going anywhere. They're sitting ducks out there. We can take our time until we're good and ready."

"Well, where's the fun in that?" "Ah, now that's more my sort. Men! Prepare to breach!"

The twelve-size crew of the Satisfaction took arms and boarded the breacher. A simple vessel for cosmic boarding under duress, it features a near-360 degree view double convex cabin compartment in front, a bulbous cargo hold, eight thin contractable separable launch beams and a chemical breaching cannon in the rear. Before I had even fully explained its function, they had already hopped on to Daedalus, spun the breaching web that melted the hull. It simply popped open for them to crawl inside. The breacher filled the resultant hole like a spidery cork, allowing the crew to embark quickly.

"Parsley!" Cpt. Morgan bellowed at a security camera in the empty passageway. "Face me now and I'll spare you the plank! Should you cower, you will be apprehended and swiftly turned to the void! So, I say to you, old man, face me now, and we will have combat decide the fate of Man's riches!"

"He's gone absolutely nuts," Cpt. Tomlin thought to himself. But damn if he wasn't sort of right. What was he to do but fight or surrender? "You're not seriously going there?" Kirchgessner, the ship's purser, balked as Cpt. Tomlin began motioning out of the mission control room. "Well, what else is there to do? We're effectively trapped and I'll be damned if I'm letting the world's entire reserve of gold go to some fucking lunatic without a fight." "How the hell are you going to fight him?" "Listen, he asked for a fight. He's going to fight me. Duel, hand-to-hand or what else there is." "Your funeral, I guess." Cpt. Tomlin couldn't decide how to respond to such impertinence in their final hour and walked out without a word.

None in his crew followed.

"Parsley!" Cpt. Morgan bellowed at Cpt. Tomlin and took aim, as did his crew. "How glad I am you took my offer! But I can't say I agree with your methods! Where have you your defences and crew? How am I to fight a defence-less man?"

Cpt. Tomlin paused to think and answered, "I thought we'd have a duel." "Oh! A duel! I suppose we could! Where have you your gun then?" "There are no guns." "No guns? This is to be even easier than I initially thought." Cpt. Morgan scratched his head with his revolver. "Err, Ramine, will you give him your–" "Absolutely not! I will not give the enemy my gun! Just shoot him already!" "I suppose I could. But that is way too easy." "Just shoot him!" "I can't do that, darlin'" "Why the fuck not!" "Why, it's Parsley." "What the fuck does that matter just shoot him! Shoot him already!" "Listen, sweetheart, how about we just throw him to the void?" "Fucking why? Goddammit, you romantics piss me the fuck off!" "Relax my dearest Ramine. It's the best compromise."

Cpt. Tomlin couldn't quite see how. "You promised me combat." "Aye, but.. listen, Parsley, sometimes things just don't go as planned, you see?" Before he could run, he had been pinned to the ground by a hench. Before he knew it, he was made to walk into the void, where he found himself in bed.

Cpt. Morgan commandeered Daedalus and turned it and its cargo of 45,000 metric tons of gold towards uncharted territory.
