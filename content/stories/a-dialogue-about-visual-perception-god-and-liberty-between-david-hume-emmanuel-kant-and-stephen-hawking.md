David Hume: Wait. What are we talking about? Visual perception? That sort of sounds something that Kand likes with his vision theories. Maybe harkens back to Plato’s Shadow Thing? But that dealing with God and Liberty? Dumb.

Stephen Hawking: Yeah. Plus, the guy writing this doesn’t know shit about either the words in the title nor what we think, or even COULD think on the subject matter.

Immanuel Kant: But it’s still something that we have to, like, do? The dialogue? Isn’t this for a story?

DH: I guess? We don’t HAVE to do anything. Obviously WE the dialog...ees(?) are powerless in some sense. The author is the one that decided when we talk and what we talk about.

IK: You don’t feel like your own being despite being a fictional character based on a philosopher?

SH: I don’t.

DH: Me neither. This is just a story. I am the writer Zhenya Frolov and I’m writing as a pretend David Hume that’s being ornery.

SH: Right.

IK: Obviously, I feel that too, but shouldn’t there be some arc that we follow to allow the reader some closure or, at least, pleasure?

SH: True. Isn’t a gimmick still there to entertain someone? Even the writer, if not the reader?

DH: As the philosopher that Zhenya likes most out of us three, I’ll say it for him: No.
