Farmer Ed and his wife Shelley stared at the pigs.

*Why’re they doing this? This ain’t normal; not normal at all. I don’t know, love. Ain’t seen anything like it before.*

The pigs were scarfing down the ashes left behind a controlled burn on the property.

*Maybe they’re confused? Sometimes the slop can look a similar color and all. I don’t know, love. Seems like they’d notice the taste?*

They ate as if it was the first food they’d seen for months. They were mowing through the ash at a stupendous pace.

*That one looks like he’s sick, darling. Oh, I think he found a coal. I hope that stops them. I don’t know, love. Don’t look like it. He’s digging back in.*

Astain, one of the more adventurous porkers, charged into the massive mound with his mouth agape. His fat body disappeared and left a crumbling hole in the ash. The other pigs followed into the opening. All the while, they chewed and swallowed frantically.

*Well look at that, honey! Why did they go and do that? I don’t know, love. I’m starting to grow concerned.*

The conga line exited the mound from a new opening. They were covered in their impromptu food. The pigs looked miserable, squealing in discomfort as their distended bellies grew with the ash. They continued their devourment.
