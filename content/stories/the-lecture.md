"And so, it is therefore inevitable that time travel be invented at one point or another in universal history, and at that point the timeline becomes highly unstable. You see, time paradoxes are possible, but not *supportable*. Whenever a paradox is seeded, the universe must auto-correct by resetting the timeline from that moment. Whatever change was made by the time traveler is not maintained, of course, because its cause only existed in a future that has been unwritten. Though... minute differences will still crop up across timelines, due to the probabilistic behavior of subatomic particles. Ah, yes, yes in the back. Speak up please. No, we know no branching occurs, we already know wave functions collapse. As far as we can tell this *is* really the only universe. Yes, it's a rather claustrophobic thought, isn't it? But the universe is full of troubling facts that we must simply accept. Of course, the leading theory to the contrary is that new offshoots can occur, *only *when the universe reaches the, er, *singularity* at the end of time. If it can reach that point without time travellers undoing all of our hard work, that is. Whatever happens in the End Times, in the *meantime *we are doomed to relive the same stretches of time, over and over, with no memory of the unwritten histories we've already built. That is also a rather troubling thought. But! What we don't know can't hurt us. Next question! Yes, you in the back again."
