So as you can see from the simulation, your idea of putting parquet on the back wall will have no effect except to deplete the balance a little. What the analysis shows is to just paint it a really stark green. Any amount of green will do, but the starker, the better, you get the point.

I'm still going to put parquet on that wall, Greg.

But you just saw the simulation. It's not like...

So what. It's just some simulation.

No, you.. yes. It's a simulation. But it's the most perfect simulation. It's like looking at an alternate reality. You might as well be, it's that perfect.

And I'm supposed to just believe that?

Yes, basically. At least believe that parquet on the back wall is not a good idea.

But I really want to.

Well, it's not going to do anything for the store.

How does it even work, anyway? Can't we just make it work?

Make what work?

The simulation.

What?

Can't we just make it show that the parquet will work?

How?

I don't know, introduce some other parameters or something.

That would probably not line up well with the reality spectral.

Look, don't think you're throwing me off with some buzzwords. I read the whitepapers.

I'm not. It's not complicated. And good, you know then how hard it is to locate a shitload of new normals.

But I still want that parquet!

Why?

It'll look nice.

No it won't.

How dare you! At least you can admit it would be nice, even if it isn't preciously "profitable" to you.

No, it would look terrible.

Worse than a stark fucking green, you crass fucking lunatic?

No, of course not. I don't want stark green. It's just the change with the best result from base.

Why a goddamn green? It'll clash with literally everything.

Maybe that's why it works. I don't fucking know.

So we're not putting any parquet on the back wall?

I have to veto that. It's purely cost.

Oh like your simulator wasn't.

Seems to me like it already paid for itself.

Doesn't work like that.

Whatever, I'm happy.

That's nice. So have you explored it?

Explored what?

The simulation?

Uh, no.

Why not?

It just-

What?

It kind of worries me, I guess.

Can I try it?

I guess.

Why are you so worried all of a sudden? You bought the damn thing.

I don't know. It just worries me is all.

How? You weren't so worried about fucking my parquet up.

Well, business is different. You're gonna use it for personal shit.

Obviously, how could I not?

I guess you're right. But, ok, imagine you're using this thing to like win your crush over.

What's there not to like?

Ok, but so you want to do that by using it to premeditate all your moves, just so you can have what you want?

Yeah?

You don't have a problem with how it eliminates, like, the personal factor or anything like that?

Not really?

Huh. Okay, well, I mean, okay then. You want to test it out now or after lunch?

Oh man, we should totally go down to - what's that place called-

I don-

The weird place, the one where nothing matched and they had those boxy hats and just said nonsense all the time? Oh my god, you don't remember?

Oh, God, yeah, of course, uh. It's-

Bob's.

Was that it?

Yeah, I think so.

Oh, yeah. Huh.
