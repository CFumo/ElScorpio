It was like many other Saturdays at the park across the black asphalt river from the brown apartment building. Two parrots sat perched near the park, separated from each other by a scar of azure sky. One sat atop the brown apartment building, next to a fire escape ladder. Her ex-lover perched across the street on a lamppost that lit the park at night, but during the day leaned over the road like a willow over a creek. The sun hung like a fruit swollen and ripe on the vine.

The exiled parakeet puffed up his yellow chest and let out a screech to his mate that scorched the sky and collided with the din of traffic and dog barks and children’s squeals. He twirled on the lamppost like a practiced gymnast saddling the pommel horse. He rubbed his greyblack beak against the feathers of his chest in wounded pride.

He was met with an icy silence from the brown apartment building where he’d spent so many sweltering nights and slow mornings. Now that building cast a menacing shadow and shared no warmth.

He let out another desperate squawk.

She looked down at him. She had promised herself she would not give in to his routine ever again. She paced the length of the roof’s ledge in anticipation. Her red head bobbed nervously, up and down, up and down. Through tight-jawed willpower, she ignored him.

Again, a sad screech of a plea. And again, the uneasy, disinterested pacing of the roof. Clouds of cotton rolled lazily across the sky. They seemed to carry the hopes of the exiled lover with them. Another screech, this one engendering a defeated tone.

Then he took one last glance at the brown apartment building, and stretched out his wings to catch a northwestern breeze that lifted his colorful frame across the backdrop of the city skyline.

She stared until the horizon swallowed him.

Then there came a peep from below. A small army of beaks chirped from the whirlwind of twigs nestled on the fire escape ladder. Mother hopped down and latched her grey talons onto one of the metal rungs. She settled the soft down of her body next to her children, and cooed.

The day remained still; cars still criss-crossed the steaming tar of the river. Mother left the nest to forage for the evening’s meal, but always with one eye turned toward the treasure at home. She flew - an angelic flash of green and yellow, grey and red in the fading light - landing in a berry shrub on the opposite side of the brown apartment building. She spied a healthy bunch of currants, newly fallen from one of the shrub’s branches. She fluttered to the dry dirt and grasped the frond of berries in her beak. She pivoted toward the brown apartment building, and flew above a line of trees.

Then she saw it — an inkblot in the sky, patiently hovering over the brown apartment building. Then the inkblot tightened into a crouch and catapulted from the heights of heaven down, down, down at the speed of death. As it descended, the inkblot grew larger and clearer — the blank darkness turned into the spotted, clipped-back wings and surgical talons of a red-tailed hawk — talons outstretched less than ten meters above the nest of twigs on the fire escape.

Berries dropped from Mother’s beak as a cry escaped her ruby red throat; she torpedoed toward the brown apartment building. But the talons closed in faster. Mother was halfway across the street when the blue sky between the talons was replaced with brown bricks, less than a meter above the nest that now chirped in alarmed, helpless protest.

But before the hawk could reach its target, a green-and-red bullet ricocheted from the northwest and throttled the red-tailed villain into the side of the fire escape. Feathers exploded in a thud and floated down to the black asphalt river — the owner of the talons crashed down into a navy blue awning that shaded the sidewalk below, and bounced off into the air in a heap of disorder. It slinked off as a crippled inkblot into the bruised red of the sunset.

Mother flew straight to her nest. She sang a song, and cooed. She scanned the scene, looking for the red-and-green bullet that disappeared after dealing the blow to the hawk. Then her eyes stopped. She found him; she let out a velvet coo in the direction of a solitary lamppost that was now casting a warm glow onto the park across the black asphalt river.
