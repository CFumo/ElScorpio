Just another evening with those whacky Hitlers! [cue laugh track] Here comes Mr. Hitler now. He steps in the door, removing his hat and sniffing the air. Mmm… Bratwurst. His favorite.

"Alois…" says Mrs. Hitler from the doorway. Uh oh. She has the tone.

"Yes dear…" [cue laugh track]

"Do you know what your mother was doing when I—" She breaks off when she hears a cry upstairs. "Oh, it's Junior."

"I'll get him," says Mr. Hitler. Saved by the baby. [cue laugh track] He walks upstairs past the family portraits, into his son's room. He lifts Baby Hitler and rubs his back gently. The baby stops crying. [cue 'aw']

He walks to the window, holding Baby Hitler and gazing into the yard. There's movement outside. He peers closer.

Downstairs, Mrs. Hitler pinches open a gap in the blinds over the window, and puts her eye slyly to the opening. [cue laugh track]

She sees their neighbor, Adolf Hitler, shuffling around the yard.

"My, that Adolf is such a silly fellow."

"Hehh??" asks Grandma Hitler, cupping her hand to her ear. [cue laugh track]

"But don't you think he looks a lot like Alois and me? It's so odd. I bet the baby will look just like him when he grows up."

"Hehhh??" asks Grandma Hitler. [cue laugh track]

"What's he getting up to anyway?" asks Mrs. Hitler. She peers closer. Adolf bends over some equipment in the yard, then turns back around. He's holding a gun. It's pointed at the upstairs window.

*Prompt, Cosmo Fumo: "I want someone to write a story about a sitcom called 'The Hitlers' where every character is Hitler. Required Characters: Mr. Hitler, Mrs. Hitler, Grandma Hitler, Baby Hitler, and their silly neighbor 'Adolf Hitler.'"*
