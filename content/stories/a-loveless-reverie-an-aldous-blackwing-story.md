Condensation coalesced and rolled off of the drinking glass. Reminiscent of the raindrops on the windows. Myriad street lights, shining through the rain, played on the walls of the dark studio apartment. An uncomfortable chill filled the living room- the shitty landlords were too stingy to replace the old radiator.

Aldous shivered against the cold. The clinking of the ice in his glass was sharp; no whiskey to dull the sound. Not for a long time.

As always, he took the month off from work. No reason for Valerie to get worried over his yearly sulk. She was a great assistant and cared about her coworkers- especially him. Aldous knew that Val had feelings for him. It wasn’t hard to notice the deep flush of her cheeks and her flirty chattiness whenever she knew he was around. Another reason to avoid her during the month of love. He didn’t want to spoil her joyful personality with his bullshit. No- Aldous was perfectly happy diving into himself and dwelling on his past. Not happy- that’d be a lie. Just content, perhaps. Content to feel the pangs of pain in his chest.

“You fucking worthless cunt,” he spoke to himself. “Wasted your goddamn time while she wasted away. Coward. Coward!”

The glass flew across the room and struck the radiator. The shattered remains joined a pizza box, a small pile of dirty underwear, and the porcelain shards of Aldous’ prior two inanimate victims. February was not his month.

He repeated his yearly mantra.

“I’m sorry, Emily. I wish I was different. I wish I was there with you during the last months. I didn’t know. Well, I did. I did know. I was just afraid. I knew that you were gonna die and I withdrew instead of giving you all of myself. I’m a piece of shit. Forgive me.”

“I already told you, sugar. I forgive you!” exclaimed the large teddy bear splayed on the couch. “I didn’t blame you during those days and I certainly don’t blame you now.”

“I abandoned you during your time of need!”

“Yes, but you were in pain too. Besides, I was on a drug cocktail that kept me in a constant stupor. Seeing me like that, Aldous, would have been worse.”

The half-human choked back tears, “And I didn’t even get the thing that made you sick in the first place.”

The expressionless face of the teddy bear seemed to grow exasperated. “The thing that killed me was cancer, dear. YOU couldn’t have killed it.”

“I could have found something. I could have grown some balls and gone planewalking to find something. Anything!”

“And risk whatever is on the other side? For dear old me? I appreciate the gesture, dear. I may have taken you up on the offer on my deathbed, but crossing over has given me perspective. And I know what kind of…” She paused. “Side effects the cures from the Others have.”

“There are good forces on the other side,” he grumbled.

“I know you don’t believe that. Like I’ve told you before- Heaven is a broken place. The glimmering corpses of angels still line the avenues. The more resilient archangels are gibbering things, half-dead and half-alive. And those are the ones that have human bloodlines. The planes you walk are much different than mine. Purity of any kind is a farce.”

Aldous knew Emily was right. After the Secret War in 2009, reality began to fray. In one instant, all the warriors of light and dark were annihilated.

“Hon,” Emily’s bear spoke with her voice. “I appreciate your feelings for me. I really do. It’s been two years, though, and you need to move on. It was one thing to cut a deal with that creep Rag’nul- for him to give me the ability to come back from the Heavenly plane in exchange for his continued mob presence in the city. Unethical, but at least the worst he does is peddle spirit powder. Not finding someone else, though- that’s too sad. Go out with Valerie. She’s wonderful and we both know she’s got the hots for you.”

Aldous blushed, “But you’ve got the freedom to watch us… you know.”

“Yeah, and I’ll touch my ghostly self,” the bear laughed. “Like I said- crossing over has given me perspective.”

“It’s hard, Em.”

“I know. I know. But try. For yourself.”

Though nothing in the room moved, Aldous felt alone again. Emily left for the evening. Just like she did whenever they had an argument where they both knew she was right.
