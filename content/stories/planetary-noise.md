Extraterrestrial beings contacted Earth on April 13, 2024 and placed official Federation strictures on our long-range communication methods to protect the world-sized, ethereal creatures they call "Light Sounders." The Sounders call potential sexual partners using a complex radio signal closely matching the pattern of radio noise generated by the Earth. Sounders in estrus would respond to the call of the Earth and pass harmlessly but ineffectively through the planet, and fail to procreate. The population decline around the Milky Way and Andromeda was noticeable enough to attract attention.
