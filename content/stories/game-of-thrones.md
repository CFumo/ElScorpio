The dragon Varmar took his golden scepter from Akalah. The fair-skinned priestess shone radiantly in the moonlight, her fashionable cloak whipping about in the wind. The scepter, phallic in shape and detail, held within it veins of ruby and chunks of emerald. It was said that the arm-length rod was True King Ruark’s own flesh- shaped by the artificers of the far land of Valaria.

Tyrion Lannister knelt before the dragon and priestess. Even though there was moonlight and a strong wind, he was sheltered within the great castle walls. His sweaty brow belied the effort it took to climb those big ol’ stairs for his lil’ ol’ stompers.

“Well met, little one,” Varmar hissed, his inhuman voice slithered into the ears of onlookers. Tyrion raised his brow at the remark.

“Not so little as I was when you first saw me,” the Imp retorted.

The dragon whined with what his kind called laughter. The wind picked up and Akalah’s cloak, bedecked with rhinestones, almost tore off.

The exchanges took mere seconds. The words lay as heavy as the golden phallus. Thousands of Unsullied flogged themselves to show penance for their earlier sins. It was time for… The Games Of Thrones.
