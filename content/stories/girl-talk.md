And what did you say?

That I'm a sub and he needs to come on to me. *But then he just said some cheesy pick up line. I wanted to go with it since he was really trying but I felt kind of awkward about it. *

Really? You guys have been together for three years...

*It's weird to discuss that sort of thing and then just start acting upon it right after. I think the excitement is in it happening organically. *

I really don't like that word but can't think of a better one.

*I know. I sound like a pretentious actor. *

So were you?

*Was I what? *

An actor? You know, "Fake it till you make it". Well, he makes it.

*No! I'm not that nice. *

What?

*I'm not going to pretend he's doing a good job if he isn't. I don't want to positively reinforce something I don't like. *

Dang girl that's cold!

*I wasn't mean! Just, you know, like I said. No positive reinforcement. I don't know what to tell him though. *

Life ain't all that sweet chickadee.

*What does that even mean? *

I don't know but it's fun to say.

*Maybe that's what I'll say to him the next time he asks why we haven't done it.*
