Ellis Jackson and Laszlo Klein had been orbiting Cleo for 291 days when Ellis fucked up big time. Ellis had two jobs: (1) Receive shipments to the spacecraft and (2) monitor Cleo’s dust storms. The trouble started when Ellis strayed from these and tried to talk to Laszlo as they prepared to switch shifts.

“Hey, come check out what I’ve done with this.” Ellis had taken the recordings of Cleo's dust storms from the past 12 hours and fiddled with the video's speed to sync perfectly with Bohemian Rhapsody. He sang along, admiring his accomplishment. Laszlo squinted at the screen, unamused, before turning toward his own station.

“I told you a thousand thousand times what I was gonna do if I ever caught you doing that!”

Ellis whipped around to find Laszlo, red in the face, pointing at his station. A slideshow of him and his ex-wife flashed across the screen.

Ellis' eyes widened in horror. He remembered the fit Laszlo had thrown when he had casually asked how Helen was doing. Laszlo had not-so-casually threatened to bash his head in if he ever spoke of her again. Naturally, Ellis had promised not to. “It’s not my fault! I swear it was like that when I got in here.”

“Don’t play coy with me. I remember exactly how I left it.”

Both seemed to overlook the possibility of one of the service bots aboard being responsible. A common, and in this case, costly, mistake.

“Whoa. Calm down. Is it really that big of a deal?” Laszlo's eyes began to bulge. Clearly, that was the wrong thing for Ellis to say.

Laszlo picked up the emergency crow bar and started swinging it like a baseball bat. “I’m going to count to three. If you don’t fix what needs fixing by then, I’ll be mopping your brains off of the ground.”

Ellis ducked as Laszlo took a swing at him. “Why does it need to come to this? I thought you got over it a long time ago.”

Laszlo would never forgive his ex-wife for divorcing him. To him, divorce didn't exist. She knew this and had purposely waited until he was off on a mission before doing it. Laszlo’s eyes stung with a mix of anger and despair. Memories of Helen flooded his mind, Ellis merely a shadow in his periphery. “I gave my word, that’s why. Because unlike yours, mine is worth something. Three. Two-”

Ellis tried to explain that he'd been very careful not to touch Laszlo's work station when the new packages came in, trying to bring Laszlo back to reality. “Look, I put the boxes there and right under here-” As Ellis reached for the lower cabinet his elbow knocked a handful of buttons. “Shit.”

Suddenly, both men were flung backwards as their tethers engaged. Their buckles, meant for safety, now acted as a prison. The huge displays flashed WARNING: EMERGENCY LANDING! as the jet engines roared to life and the service bots engaged to execute the landing.

Ellis could barely make out the sound of Laszlo cursing him out. “You’re dead to me, Jackson. Hear that? Dead to me.”

That was the last Ellis heard from him before they plummeted to the dusty surface of Cleo.
