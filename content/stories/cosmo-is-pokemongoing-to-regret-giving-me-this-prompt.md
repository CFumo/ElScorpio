***Prompt:*

***"Bulbasaur. Tentacle. Porn." - Marcie Phillips*

“Frick yes!!!”

Cosmo was so excited to start his day. He’d been waiting for this for ages. He was such a huge Pokemon Go fan, but now that second generation pokemon had been added, his joy was uncontainable. He buttoned his shirt, checked to make sure his fly was up four times (because four is the number of times that prevents his family from dying), and headed for the door. Once he had secured the velcro on his shoes, he was on his way!

Cosmo bobbed and weaved his way through the herds of slovenly nerds and finally arrived at the park. Checking the radar function, Cosmo could clearly make out the silhouette of his favorite pokemon ever somewhere in the vicinity. “HOLY HECK!”, he shouted, alarming several nearby parents, “It’s a plucking STANTLER!”

Cosmo’s search for the ugly deer with below average stats and essentially no use in the actual game lead him to a more secluded area. He jumped over a small stream, climbed a fence, and pushed through some bushes. He was here. The gosh dang stantler was near him, but he could not get the farking thing to appear!

“I knew I’d find you here.”

The voice came seemingly from nowhere. Cosmo felt completely overwhelmed trying to locate the source but also still actively trying to find that dadgum Stantler.

Alisa Rosenbaum walked calmly out of the bushes. She had a smile on her face that would look sinister on anyone else but it’s Alisa Rosenbaum so it’s just kinda funny and you’re happy to see the girl.

“Oh, hey girl.” Said Cosmo, eyes still predominantly on his phone because WHERE THE FUCK IS THIS DEER.

“Have you tried out the new feature yet, friend?” Alisa sounded pretty sinister still, but come on it’s Alisa Rosenbaum! She’s probably just setting up some awesome joke! Just wait!

“No! What is it?” Cosmo could only assume that a new feature meant a device that allowed you to catch three, maybe FOUR stantlers at the same time! Humanity may not be ready for such a feature, but Cosmo Fumo definitely is!

“Watch!” Alisa pulled out her phone. She pointed the phone at Cosmo and swiped up, as if throwing a pokeball. The pokeball flew out of her phone, through the air, and collided with Cosmo’s head.

“Not cool, man.” Cosmo sputtered before being engulfed in light and transported into the pokeball. After three very SENSUAL wiggles, the pokeball stopped. Cosmo had been caught.

Alisa sent Cosmo back out.

“Golly, What’s going on?”

Alisa's smile was admittedly pretty sinister this time. I mean, she did just capture a guy.

“If trainers control pokemon, and I control trainers, then I suppose you have just witnessed THE BIRTH OF A GOD!” Alisa adopted a pose reminiscent of a cartoon villain, but it was still pretty charming because Alisa was doing it.

“Gee…” Cosmo was only half listening because he still hadn’t found that hecking stantler.

“It’s time for some… *special *training.” Alisa swiped again on her phone, releasing another pokeball.

“Bulba, Bulbasaur!” the small green creature cried because apparently people in that world just named animals after whatever sound they made which seems kinda weird and juvenile and really wouldn’t work in our world because we’d have fifty animals named “ARF ARF” and “\*high-pitched screech\*”.

A vine shot out of the green onion dinosaur thing’s back and wrapped itself tightly around Cosmo’s ankle. Before he could realize what happened (which admittedly takes a while when he’s focused on deer pokemon), Cosmo was hanging upside down half a foot above the ground. Young, stylish Alisa Rosenbaum snapped her fingers and a flurry of razor sharp leaves flew from the Bulbasaur’s back. It was a move called Razor Leaf. This world was not very creative in its naming conventions.

The leaves flew by Cosmo without making contact, but he realized their true purpose.  What few tatters of clothes that remained on Cosmos body were now falling to the ground. He was now hanging, both NAKED AND AFRAID. Like that TV show: Survivor: Pearl Islands.

A gentle breeze blew past the scene, which was enough to give Cosmo a raging boner. Seeing his chance, Bulbasaur, the leafy lizard, loosed two more vines on its hapless victim. One wrapped around Cosmo’s fully erect member while the other began lightly spanking his surprisingly supple badonkadonk.

“Wait, don’t bulbasaurs only have two vines?”

“No, fuck you."

And with that, two more vines came rushing out of the green Hershey’s kiss Bulbasaur was carrying on his back for later. The first went straight for his mouth, entering with great force. It not only silenced him, but gave him that all too familiar feeling of orally servicing a very long penis. Just as he was beginning to enjoy this, the fifth?, I don’t know, I wasn’t really counting, vine wrapped around his midsection and traveled up to his anus, entering with reckless abandon.

Cosmo began to blush. What if that stantler was watching? He could never go back to her now…

But somehow the rush of shame he was feeling only increased his sexual pleasure. The one vine moved slowly in and out of his mouth. The other vine massaged his throbbing dingle dangle. The third one spanked harder and harder. The fourth one felt kinda left out because it was still just holding him up by the ankle and would’ve liked to participate a little more actively. And the fifth one, let’s call him Frank, was approaching the part of the rectum where it stops feeling good and it just kinda hurts but not hitting that point so it was still pretty good for both of them

Surprising Alisa, Bulbasaur, and Frank, Cosmo let out a really girly giggle and ejaculated. That fourth vine wasn’t very surprised though.

Bulbasaur retracted however many vines there were and went back into his pokeball.

“Hey, wanna come over and watch Felix play Bloodborne?”

“Yeah, sure."
