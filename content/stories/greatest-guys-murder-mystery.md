After they found Zhenya’s dead body in the billiard room, the Greatest Guys were gathered in the library trying to decide how to handle the situation. Ice clicked in glasses of brandy, and Cosmo blew nervously on his bubble pipe. Standing in front of the fireplace, Graham read Zhenya’s note out loud for the third time.

‘Dearest darklings, in the unfortunate eventuality that I have died, this note will lead you to the person I most suspect will be my killer…’

“So what do we do with the body in the meantime?” asked Cosmo.

Alice’s cup of Da Hong Pao froze halfway to her lips. “Excuse me? The ‘body’? That’s your fucking friend out there lying dead on the pool table and you’re just gonna refer to him as ‘the body’?”

“Yeah but it’s Zhenya,” Cosmo said. “He’s the last person who’d want us to be sentimental about his corpse.”

“What the fuck!” said Alice, turning red in the face.

Alisa stared down into her hot toddy. She was terrified of dying, and having the concept so forcefully brought to her attention was making her very uncomfortable. And also, what was with that weird rhyme scheme in Zhenya’s note? It didn’t seem characteristic of him at all, and that was also making her very uncomfortable.

“It’s fucking Zhenya gibberish.” Graham crumpled the note in his imposing fist. “He probably meant it as a joke and didn’t think he would *actually *die.” He flicked the note into the fireplace.

“No wait!” the other guys shouted. The note burned.

“Oh well,” Cosmo said. “Why don’t we split up and see if there are any other clues?” Cosmo and Graham went to look in the kitchen while Alice and Alisa headed toward the garage. The only car in the garage was a champagne-colored 2015 Rolls-Royce Phantom Coupe.

“Phew,” said Alice, running her hand along the hood of the car.

“Look!” said Alisa. “There’s a trapdoor under the rear left tire. But how are we gonna get to it without the car keys?”

“Don’t worry, I’ve got this,” said Alice, pulling her lockout tool out of her back pocket.

“I’ll go get the other guys,” Alisa said as Alice started unlocking the car door. Back in the house, she was thinking absentmindedly about Zhenya’s note when she ran into a panicked looking Graham.

“I found all these weird voodoo dolls,” said Graham, “and I don’t know where Cosmo went.”

In his hands were a dozen wax figurines that looked exactly like him, right down to the curly hair and the Apple Watch.

“What the fuck?” said Alisa. “Let’s see if Cosmo went back to the billiard room.”

They made their way back to the billiard room carrying the voodoo dolls. But when they got there, the body was gone. Graham and Alisa looked at each other across the pool table.

“...where’d he go?” asked Alisa.

A trapdoor in the corner of the room suddenly flew open and Alice popped out. Alisa and Graham screamed.

“Holy shit guys,” said Alice, “there’s all these tunnels down here!”

“Did you move the car?” Alisa asked.

“Yeah, it was a piece of cake.”

The door opened and Cosmo walked in with a strange expression on his face.

“You’ll never guess who I found in the hallway,” he said. Zhenya walked in after him. There was a general uproar over his reappearance.

“Jesus dude, we thought you were dead!” Alice exclaimed.

“WHO, MEE!?” said Zhenya, choking back laughter.

“Oh, he was just dicking around,” Graham said, shaking his head in disgust.

Zhenya fell on the floor laughing. While Graham and Alice fussed over Zhenya, Cosmo went up to Alisa and handed her a piece of paper.

“I found the last clue, but I don’t understand it. I guess it doesn’t matter because he’s alive.” Alisa unfolded the paper. It read ‘Graham did it.’

Later that night Alisa lay awake in bed, turning over the events of the evening in her mind. She couldn’t stop thinking about the clues they’d found. What did they mean? Feeling restless, she decided to go through the trapdoor in the billiard room.

The tunnels were dark and nearly unnavigable. After a half hour of stumbling around in the dark, she finally found a door. With a creeping feeling, Alisa opened the door and heard the sounds of machinery and medical equipment. She flipped on the light and saw dozens of Zhenya clones in fluid-filled tanks lining the room. Alisa's mind reeled at the existential implications of this discovery. How long had it been since they’d known the original Zhenya? What did it matter? Alisa didn’t even realize she was whispering “no” over and over again until she heard the door close behind her.

“I almost got away with it, but you just couldn’t let it go,” said Graham.

“So it really was you,” said Alisa, pulling out her switchblade.
