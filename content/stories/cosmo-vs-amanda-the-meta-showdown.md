*Cosmo*: I think we should write something explaining all of our Cosmo Vs. Amanda Showdown stories.

*Amanda*: What! No. It’s more fun if we don’t. Although I guess it’s kind of obnoxious.

*Cosmo*: We should write a Showdown story about us talking about our Showdown stories.

*Amanda*: Ehh that’s way too confusing. And we only really have one so far...

*Cosmo*: Hah, but I thought you loved writing metafiction! It could start with us just talking like this… actually it could just be this stuff that we’re saying right now. But as a story.

*Amanda*: Come on. That’s so obvious. The thing I like the most about the Ultimate Showdown is how unexpected it is.

*Cosmo*: I think we can make this one pretty weird too. We can write it as if we’ve already written a bunch of other Showdowns, even though we haven’t, and then it’ll be like our fictional selves tricked our real selves into writing a bunch of dumb stories.

*Amanda*: I think you’re losing me…

*Cosmo*: All I’d have to do is namedrop some random story idea like

*Cosmo*: Hey, remember when we wrote Cosmo Vs. Amanda: The Fantastical Showdown! What a good story that was!

and then BAM, the fictional Cosmo forced a real story into existence. Wouldn’t that be awesome?

*Amanda*: But if we’re making this whole conversation into a meta story, then wouldn’t that part be like a … double-meta part? And then would the double-fictional Cosmo be making the single-fictional Cosmo write a fictional story or would it like, propagate all the way up into reality?

*Cosmo*: I think if we acknowledge it in the single-fiction then it would propagate, yeah.

*Amanda*: Dude, I think this is just going to confuse everyone who reads it.

*Cosmo*: C’mon! Now I’m excited to write it. I could probably stay up late on, I don’t know, Thursday, March 11th until, like, 12:33am or something and just bust it out.

*Amanda*: Fine! You win. We’ll write it. But this is the only Showdown you’re winning.
