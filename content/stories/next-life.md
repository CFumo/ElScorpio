My death took me by surprise and I certainly wasn't happy about it. I knew it had happened when I heard a ghostly gender-less voice call me.

"Welcome."

“Shit”, I thought, “I was wrong. God is real and now I'm going to hell.”

“God," the voice scoffed. “What a silly human construct.”

I didn't know what to say.

“Don't worry.,” The voice sounded more female now. “You'll like it here. And the change in my voice is simply to put you at ease. You respond better to uncertainty when you're faced with a female.”

“But what are you,” I whispered.

“I am everything. I am beyond your imagination.” The last word I tasted.

“Synesthesia,” I thought.

“Yes,” I saw. “But much much more.” These words I heard from my own mouth.

You weren't wrong. There isn't an afterlife. This is life. I couldn't tell if these thoughts were being told to me or if they were my own.

Open your eyes.

They are open.

Open them again.

And then I did. Wondrous spirits flashed before my eyes.

Again.

Once more I opened my eyes and this time the spirits had been replaced by sounds.

Over and over I discovered this realm in every human sense and dozens of formerly incomprehensible ones.

Welcome, the voice said as it settled within me. You are born.
