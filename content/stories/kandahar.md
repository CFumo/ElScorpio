The supersonic crack of a rifle bullet jolted Private First Class Howell out of a daydream. She had been staring at an overturned wicker basket approximately four yards away and wondering when it would spontaneously catch fire from the sunlight.

“Fuck it’s hot today” she muttered, rubbing a tender spot under her chin strap.

Another bullet snapped through the air overhead. And then another. Then a trio of them in rapid succession. One of the last three passed through the wicker basket and kicked up a cloud of hot dust.

“I GUESS THEY DIDN’T ACTUALLY FORGET ABOUT US!” yelled Private Burnett very loudly from a few yards to Howell’s left. The four of them had been hiding from bullets and various explosives behind a low broken wall for most of the day.

Private Richards craned his neck in a failed attempt to look over the wall behind him. “So when does the big plane come to kill the bad guys?”

“I think it’s about to get here two hours ago,” said Hoffman, grinning at his own apparent bitterness.

Howell could tell that her team was getting restless.. She needed to keep them focused. She needed to keep herself focused.

“Okay guys, let’s play it.”

They all responded at once in a chorus that sounded something like “ArNO FUyou serioCKING WAY joking...!?”

“I’m serious. Weapons check first. I’m all set so..  Check!”

“Check!” Said Hoffman.

“..Check..  Also!” Said Richards after a worrying pause.

“I COULD USE A MAG BUT OTHERWISE CHECK?” Asked Burnett.

Hoffman punched Burnett hard enough in the side to make an audible thud. “Stop screaming in my ear, dick!”

Four more rifle rounds fractured the silence. The soldiers squeezed even closer to the protective shade of the wall. Howell took the opportunity to pull an extra magazine out of her vest and toss it at Burnett. It bounced off of his helmet and landed next to him. They exchanged rude gestures.

“Okay,” Started Howell, “Never have I ever...  uhh..  eaten a raw potato!”

“Fuck!”

Burnett jumped up from where he was seated and rested the barrel of his rifle on the top of the wall. He let off three short bursts and dropped back down.

“Yeah, I didn’t see anyone. Your turn Richards.”

“Never have I ever..   Had my ears blown out by a grenade that I didn’t throw far enough.”

Hoffman snorted.

“You motherfuckers,” Growled Burnett. He hopped back up and fired off another burst in a new direction. A rifle round cracked past his head. He cursed and hit the floor.

“10 O’Clock, maybe 300 yards. I’m gonna fuck you guys so hard.”

Hoffman started next; “Never have I ever OBVIOUSLY SHIT MYSELF during a firefight.”

“God damn I knew it!” Howell laughed.

Richards silently stood up, readied his weapon, and fired a few shots. He dropped back down to the cool shade behind the wall.

“I’m surprised you assholes could smell me at all over your own stench. I might have hit one of them. Bring it on Burnett.”

“Never have I ever drunk dialed my ex wife looking to hook up.”

Howell and Richards made a chorus of “OOOH” noises.

Hoffman punched Burnett in the side again and stood up. He froze for a second, cursed, and dropped back down behind the wall.

“I think I saw another RPG. Where’s that fucking air support!?”

“I’ve got an idea,” answered Howell, and then after a brief dramatic pause; “Never have I ever had sex with a woman. Suck it assholes.”

The three soldiers groaned in unison. Richards, Hoffman, and Burnett wearily discussed a firing order, counted down from three, and then jumped up began a cacophonous barrage of gunfire.

Sliding down into a more comfortable position Howell looked back at the wicker basket. As spent bullet casings rained down around her she began to wonder if she should just light the damn thing on fire herself.
