The mood was right.

Driving beats from Ludacris’ Red Light District entranced the soul and excited the loins. Rick arched his neck at George, yearning for his touch. To have heard of the legendary Cock of Mumbai for years and finally seeing it- a true wonderland of experience.

“Rick. How delightful that name sounds,” he murmured.

“It’s not the only thing that’s delightful. Try gobbling my hole.”

He spoke Rick’s name.

“Ah ah ah!”

“Nice.”

Their bodies, connected by dicks, writhed. Rick loved being one with George. He fantasized about sharing a single body with him. Breathing as one, moving as one, shitting as one. Rick felt an emotion greater than anything he had felt before. Was it worship? Surely not- George was out of his social class and the relationship would not last.

“Wanna take it up the ass?” his reverie interrupted by his rich voice.

“Yes!”

“Then roll onto your back.”

And so he did. Hours passed in sexual delirium. When Rick thought he could take no more, something surprising happened!

“I have to tell you a dark truth. I am half-pedophile.”

Every orifice tensed. Did he hear George right? Was he truly a pederast?

“I knew that!”

He growled, “I knew you would say that.”

“That isn’t what-”

His lips were blocked with his cock.

A shameful orgasm wracked his body. He felt great regret and started weeping.
