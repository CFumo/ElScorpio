Junior's life thus far was like an indefinite stint in a waiting room. He floated in a nutrientrich fluid and quietly grew. One of his few pleasures was to press himself against the walls of his enclosure, where sometimes he would feel a warm pressure from the other side. One day when he did this, instead of a warm square, he felt a cold circle. He pressed himself to the other side and felt a matching circle there. Soft piano music flowed out of the circles and invaded his space. The melody was strong and almost unbearably sentimental, pervaded by a sort of nostalgic melancholy. God—would it ever stop? It was so damn schmaltzy… he couldn't stand it. He had to get out. He had to get out *now*.
