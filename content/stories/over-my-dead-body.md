Felix watched as the rose fell limply from his fingers. Loved ones hugged around him in a crush of pain and mourning, but he didn’t feel a thing. A vacuum of sensation dimmed his awareness of the lowering casket. The world shrank away from him. He was a blank stare, a blank face, a blank mind. Sam, she…the thought never reached its end.

Once at the apartment, he stripped out of the black suit, quickly shirtless and back in loose shorts. For what felt like forever, he hadn’t found reason to wear anything else. Today was the exception. He lay on the floor of the living room, allowing his thoughts to be swallowed by wordless grief. He barely registered his roommate Cosmo as he drifted in the front door, like a murky figure floating at the edge of an endless haze.

Felix closed his eyes and tried not to feel.

“Hey bro,” nearby a voice, husky from crying, broke through the fog. Cosmo lowered himself to lie next to Felix. A doleful glance was all he received in response. Together they rested there in silence for over an hour. Felix finally spoke. “I can’t believe it. It doesn’t feel real.”

“I know, man,” Cosmo said as he sat up and pulled one knee to his chest. He sucked in a breath and exhaled slowly, “It sucks. At least…” He struggled to find the silver lining.

“Yeah.”

They dragged themselves to the couch and browsed Netflix aimlessly. Neither could muster the energy to decide on anything, but there was nothing else to do or say. So, when the tedium no longer soothed, Felix stood to go to bed. Cosmo wasn’t tired, but his bed seemed a welcome retreat from the day, so he got up to do the same. They both stood at either end of the couch for a moment, then collapsed into a hug and cried and shook and held each other up.

“I miss her. I miss her already.”

“Me too. Me too.”

Their knuckles were white with the force of their grasping. They finally released themselves to closeness after each feeling so far away from everything for a week. Their arms tensed almost to the point of strain. They breathed in choking spurts, but as the embrace lingered their lungs were eventually able to fill more deeply and evenly. Their muscles loosened; their minds settled into the comfort of a friend.

At last, Felix pulled back to look Cosmo in his red-rimmed eyes. They gazed deeply at each other like never before, searching for what could be next. Without any intention, their hands began to crawl towards each others hips. Their heads bent together, mouths watering with anticipation for something thoughtless and comforting. Slowly the space began to diminish between their lips.

Just before their eyes closed completely, a flash of white ignited between them and they stumbled apart in surprise.

Pursed-lipped and ghostly, Sam floated in place, arms crossed in ethereal annoyance, taking time to look them each in the eyes. Then, she shook her head and sighed,  “Not even, guys. Not even.” Before either of them could even blush, her apparition shimmered and was gone.
