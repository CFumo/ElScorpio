Tom walks on set, sits down, sets up his laptop

Meg walks in, sits down, sets up her laptop. Tom’s clearly eyeing her and a bit bashful about it.

Tom is logging into his favorite mmorpg on his computer. Center stage is now lit. Tom’s Avatar, a tall, strong knight, walks to center stage and pantomimes fighting enemies in a video game.

A moment later, Meg’s avatar, a female mage, joins Tom’s avatar center stage. Both people are still lit as well, and you can see them typing and playing on their laptops.

TOM’S AVATAR: Oh, hey! What’re you doing on here tonight!

MEG’S AVATAR: Hey…

TOM’S AVATAR: I thought you had that hot date tonight?

MEG’S AVATAR: Yeah… He kinda… stood me up.

TOM’S AVATAR: WHAT? That sucks!

MEG’S AVATAR: Yeah, I waited for that asshole for half an hour before he told me he wasn’t going to show. Luckily I brought my laptop, so I’m just sitting in a little cafe playing for a bit before I head home…. But what about you? What’re you doing on here on a friday night

TOM’S AVATAR: Ha… What else would I be doing?

MEG’S AVATAR: I dunno, you don’t have some awful tinder date set up too?

TOM’S AVATAR: No, no… I like to let that kind of thing happen more organically

MEG’S AVATAR: Really? And how’s that treating you?

Tom’s Avatar: It, uh.. it isn’t…

MEG’S AVATAR: I Figured.

*\*She laughs\* *

TOM’S AVATAR: I dunno… I just feel like I never really meet anybody I want to pursue...

MEG’S AVATAR: Have you ever thought that maybe the reason we aren’t really meeting anybody new is because… well, we’re playing video games alone on a friday night?

*\*beat\**

ALL FOUR: NAAAAAHHHHH...

TOM’S AVATAR: Anyway, I’m not even alone. I’m also sitting at a little cafe near my place. Figured I’d get some caffeine and some gaming done before we raid tonight.

MEG’S AVATAR: Oh? *\*she smiles\** any cute girls?

TOM’S AVATAR: Well, actually… Yeah, there’s this one girl here on her computer...

MEG’S AVATAR: What!? Go talk to her!

TOM’S AVATAR: Huh?

MEG’S AVATAR: Show me how well your “organic” method works!

TOM’S AVATAR: Well, uh

MEG’S AVATAR: C’mon!

TOM’S AVATAR: Okay fine…

Tom eyes Meg on the other side of the room. He fiddles around with things at his table, obviously killing some time. He stands up and walks around his own table before sitting down.

TOM’S AVATAR: Back

MEG’S AVATAR: Well?

TOM’S AVATAR: I walked up to this girl, right? I said hey and commented on what a nice laptop she had, and she just immediately responds with “I have a boyfriend”.

MEG’S AVATAR: Dang. Cold. Well, I for one would appreciate a guy recognizing the power of ol’ Bertha here. I’ve put a lot of work and money into this thing.

TOM’S AVATAR: What? That wouldn’t be creepy to you?  Some guy comes up and says “Hey, nice laptop”

MEG’S AVATAR: Hell no, a lot better than “nice rack”

TOM’S AVATAR: Guess I didn’t think of it like that…

MEG’S AVATAR: Oh, shoot. I better get going. It’s almost time for that raid and there’s no way in hell I’m running it on shitty cafe wifi.

TOM’S AVATAR: Oh man, good point. I should pack up too.

MEG’S AVATAR: See you back online in half an hour?

TOM’S AVATAR: For sure!

Lights dim on MEG’S AVATAR and TOM’S AVATAR

Meg and Tom both start packing up their things. Tom is a little ahead and gets to the door first. He holds it open for Meg.

Tom: After you!

Meg: Oh, thank you good sir

Meg walks through. Tom is clearly visibly upset and wants to say more but is struggling.

Lights turn back on MEG’S AVATAR and TOM’S AVATAR. MEG’S AVATAR is giving a gentle smile.

TOM’S AVATAR: Dude. Just go for it.

Lights dim back down

Tom, clearly struggling: ….HEY!

Meg stops and turns around.

Tom: That’s a pretty sweet laptop I saw you had back there.

Meg: Oh, thanks! Yeah, I do a lot of gaming, so I had to build something myself that I knew could handle it!

Tom: Really? What kinds of games are you into?

They walk off

Lights back onto MEG’S AVATAR and TOM’S AVATAR. They smile and hold hands while they watch them walk off.
