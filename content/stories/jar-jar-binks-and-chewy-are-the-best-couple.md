Jar Jar was on the hunt. The hunt for some mad fur in his looooong GunGun mouth. He wanted a hairball. Balls. Chewbacca’s bawlz.

Chewbacca was taking a day off from The Millennium Flcon and was doing his usual vacation thing (tradition) of eating a whole bunch of Viagra to let some steam off. As one does.

Alf watches. He is the stalker.

On the twelfth night of Tattooine’s Hanukkah celebrations, the aliens decided to hook up. There was a whole lot of chemistry and Jar Jar couldn’t keep his yearning tongue away. His long slimy fingers. Just poked. Themselves into. Chewie’s mouth, like “Meeehhh.”

“Don’t take so long to enter me,” Chewbacca murmured. “Don’t make a dame wait by the side of the road for over two hours.”

Jar Jar raised an eyebrow (cuz he has those), “like roadkill, sexy?” He slowly, uncomfortably winks. It’s hard to tell if he is sleepy and closing one eye or if he is trying to be demure. When he was a little kid on his home planet, Jar Jar was once confronted by a pack of wild dogs. They took turns fuckin’ his eye- just the one- and he developed the Wink Delay™.

Alf toyed with his dinner at the Tanners’. It wasn’t Looky, the cat, as Alf wished for. It was Lasagna. This angered Alf because Garfield LOVES Lasagna.

Well, they fucked.
