Dawn of the dead, dearly beloved,

Cosmic shades of past misfortunes

Cascade and curtail precious plans

Of flight and disassociation.

Dissect diligently,

Let not the hammer fall

Without adept control and experience.

The blues carries with it

An immense gravity,

Laden with the worldâ€™s distorted underbelly.

Infer access points

To garner greater human meaning and understanding.

Pull magic out of hands sleight

And cards dealt not in favor.

Depth not measured in leagues,

Distance not measured in meters.
