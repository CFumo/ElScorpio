The iris opens, revealing a vessel stored within. By ejecting combusted material, the vessel jerks upward. Using precision instruments, the missile follows a set path precisely. The path quickly slopes to become tangential to the surface. The missile achieves orbital velocity within minutes.

Few were happy with this development. Least of all the Swiss, who had been attempting to mediate the negotiations. They had made a lot of progress, they felt. The ceasefire had worked really well. An understanding, perhaps already an agreement, on the disposal of the strange matter was within sight. And then an offhand remark by an American general landed poorly on the Geminis. His intention was purely to jest. It was only a joke. "Take a joke," he said.

The Gemini envoy walked out. The ceasefire concluded immediately with irradiated, viral and toxic cocktails dropped into major population centers. They didn't intend to decimate the population. Obviously, most people should have already taken shelter outside the cities and hid underground, as is normal for this kind of situation. The intention was only to show how offended they were. As the most intelligent beings in this sector of the Galaxy and of very high sophistication, they would prefer not to be insulted by such apes. Naturally, the natives couldn't understand such a gesture and responded not by admitting fault, but by launching their entire arsenal against their fleet. How uncouth! It's just not proper!

They had only wanted to extract the strange matter that had fallen on Earth, in parts of Maine and New Hampshire. They really were doing the people a favor by taking it all, anyway. It's not a very sightly matter. It doesn't sparkle, it doesn't glow. It's mostly akin to goo. It doesn't even power any fancy electronics, I mean really. Why would they even want to keep it? Furthermore, the Geminis were giving them all jobs. Every single earthling, young and old would have a job with the finest strange matter extracting company in the Universe. But their lazy asses couldn't accept such a generous offer.

Greedy, lazy and selfish. That about summed them up by the Geminis' estimates. First they attempt to block the rightful extraction of a natural resource. They had the permits, it was all set up. The harm to any local ecology would be well within interstellar guidelines and mostly reversible. Then they reject the gracious offer to assist the Geminis. Since they wouldn't offer any help and they wanted to keep the-absolutely useless to them-strange matter, the Geminis decided to enforce their divine right to the goods.

The final straw came when the people attacked the aliens. Lavish labour camps had been set up for them and people all over the world were invited to join, every single one of them. Even the old and the sick. There were no problems with this arrangement, even though most people felt like there were. It seemed to the Geminis that many were preferring a fiery death over just getting a job. It was free, too.

In an effort to glean some insight into why they would resist assisting the noble Geminis in acquiring some typical strange matter, which is only useful to spacefaring and highly intelligent beings, they had a meeting with some people that chose to consider themselves leaders of the population. The Geminis were a little worried about the arrangement, as it did not befit a species in their employ to have any leaders. But they relented, and talks finally commenced in Geneva, Switzerland. The aliens had picked the spot out of seeming respect. For what, nobody is sure.

Everything was going well, the Geminis understood that most people already have jobs, and for some reason families that depend on them surviving. It was not necessary to relocate them en masse overnight and instruct them on how to perform their new duties. That process should be performed gently over a period of time using economics. This idea seemed agreeable, if a little foreign. Why not simply do their divine duty to the Geminis? To further explain, an American general made a joke about the situation, "I mean, you don't want us to think you're some damn slavers, do you?"

High above, the missile orbited. It was one of thousands on a course intercepting the mothership. No more than ten minutes passed from launch until contact with the mothership. The blast annihilated it instantaneously. The rest of the missiles, save a few that exploded on collision with debris, orbited Earth for months, some for years. The people got to keep their strange matter and by reverse engineering the Geminis' many vehicles and equipment became a spacefaring civilization.
