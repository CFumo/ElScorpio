One day The Angriest Clown woke up and he was MAD.

Sunlight streamed through his broken window and shone into his eyes. It made The Angriest Clown REALLY angry.

The threadbare blanket was being chewed on by rats. Their nibbling was loud and The Angriest Clown was ENRAGED.

The Angriest Clown tried to get out of his soiled bed, but his clown hair got caught in the slats of the headboard. The pain drove The Angriest Clown to pure HATRED.

Slippery slime was all over the carpet, so when The Angriest Clown finally got out of bed, he slipped and twisted his large ankle. The fall really got on The Angriest Clown’s NERVES.

The Angriest Clown got up, but got poked by the old, dirty needles on the floor. The Angriest Clown was FURIOUS.

As The Angriest Clown stormed out of his messy bedroom, he hit his head on a broken lightbulb in the hallway. The Angriest Clown furrowed his bloody brow in SEETHING animosity.

The Angriest Clown limped to the kitchen where his Chihuahua, Benny, slept. The Angriest Clown tripped over Benny and was BITTER.

The Angriest Clown kicked Benny hard across the room. His hurt ankle snapped and he was completely UPSET.

Hobbling over to his refrigerator for a cold compress, The Angriest Clown noticed the stained letter from his estranged wife. He started crying and become INCONSOLABLE.

Letting his gaze sweep over the swampy, rotting kitchen and living room, The Angriest Clown saw the empty crib of his dead son. The Angriest Clown became downright DEPRESSED and hatched a plan.

After catching crippled Benny, getting his son’s tattered bib, and a cup of vile orange juice, The Angriest Clown began the ritual. He crushed Benny’s little doggy tummy over the bib and dropped the freshly stained cloth into the stinking juice. The Angriest Clown downed the drink and felt COMMITTED.

The Angriest Clown went back in time and killed his parents.
