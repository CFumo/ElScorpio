Over the last ~20 months, my fellow Scorpions may have gotten a glimpse at my imagination and life. Some, more than others, have been exposed to my ups and downs. I want to bring my story in the last couple of years to everyone, however. It’s only fair. Let’s start at the beginning.

Soon after buying my home in Seattle, I thought my life was on a steady path of abundant happiness and bliss. Unfortunately, upon returning to my abode one night, I found three drug addicts that had broken in. I rushed to protect my wife and newborn daughter, but made a horrific discovery- they had been brutally murdered by the men that were, in the police reports, purported to be on a new street drug *Valkyr*. Weeks later, after the funeral of the loves of my life, I was transferred to the DEA.

Months later, I was employed as an undercover agent in the Punchinello Mafia, the family responsible for dealing Valkyr. My coworker B.B. asked me to meet his best friend Alex at the Downtown Seattle Link light rail station. There, I encountered Jack Lupino’s goons. There was a prolonged shootout. No survivors on their end. I escaped and tried to meet Alex, but he was shot killed by an assassin. Through my connections, I heard that I was the #1 suspect in the investigation of Alex’s murder. What’s worse, the Punchinello family was tipped off about my undercover status. I was hounded by everyone- most of all, revenge.

Later, on my search for Lupino- the Punchinello right hand man- I busted a Valkyr drug deal. Turns out, Vladimir Lem, a Russian mobster, was starting a mob war against Punchinello. I also shot and wounded Vinnie Gognitti, Lupino’s right-hand man. Chasing him through Capitol Hill, I found Lupino’s hideout in a nightclub. After a brutal shootout, Lupino lay dead and I was closer to avenging my dead family.

But my luck would take a turn for the worse- I met Mona Sax, who turned out to be an assassin. A drink I shared with her was drugged and I woke up bound on my way to the Mafia’s torture facility disguised as a butcher’s. Luckily, I escaped due to the goons’ incompetence. The only person I could turn to was Lem. I knew that I needed weapons- lots of them. I made a deal with the Russians; I would kill Boris Dime, one of Vladimir’s traitorous ex-allies aboard a ship moored at the Docks of Seattle in exchange for the illegal firearms held aboard the boat. It was a mutually beneficial deal.

After my success, I went to a Mafia-owned restaurant near the University Street Transit Station. There was an explosive trap, but I was lucky and survived the blast. It was the last straw- I took my cache of weapons and sieged Don Angelo Punchinello’s home in West Seattle. The bloodbath was extraordinary, but my revenge was not satisfied. Not only did I discover the dead Lisa Punchinello, Mona’s sister, but also the puppeteers behind the Punchinello family. I was caught off-guard by a private security force and stripped of my weapons. Nicole Horne, the CEO of Aesir Corporation, killed Don Punchinello and injected me with a massive dose of Valkyr. I was left for dead.

I’m a hard man to kill, however. After going through the agony of overdose and withdrawal, I took the only lead I had- an underground military research complex underneath a large building in the Industrial District in South Seattle. I discovered that Valkyr was developed by the U.S. military in the 90s to improve soldiers’ stamina and morale as part of the Valhalla Project. It was scrapped soon after inception due to poor results, but Horne kept the research and manufacture going under the radar. I also found out that my wife accidentally discovered this information and, at Horne’s behest, was murdered by the three Valkyr test subjects.

Aesir, upon finding out about my intrusion, turned on their facility’s kill switch, *Operation Dead Eyes*. All the scientists and evidence perished just as I leapt outside of the kill zone.

I got a call from B.B., the treacherous bastard who I found out killed Alex and framed me, called for a meeting in a parking lot under a highrise in downtown. It was an ambush. I killed countless men in that garage whilst chasing B.B., before gunning him down.

Alfred Woden contacted me soon after. I was asked to come to the Space Needle and I obliged the request. Alfred turned out to be a part of Inner Circle, a secret society with strong influence over the U.S. government. Alfred and his compatriots revealed Nicole Horne’s identity and location, along with their displeasure at her actions with Valkyr. They asked me to kill her in exchange for dropping all of my criminal charges.

After our agreement, the Needle was overrun by Aesir gunmen. Everyone except me and Alfred were gunned down while we escaped.

This was the last straw. I went to Columbia Center, which housed Aesir Corporation. While a minigun-toting helicopter flew around the building, taking shots at me, I steadily made my way up the floors. Countless were left dead by my hand. I encountered Mona Sax in an elevator, who was clearly working for Aesir. However, she refused to shoot me. That decision cost her life; Horne’s bodyguards shoot her in cold blood before I could stop them. The chase was still on.

I got to the top of the building through a roof-access staircase. I tried to kill Nicole, but she jumped into the helicopter that was hounding me previously. Before she escaped, I managed to shoot a cable anchoring an antenna, which snapped directly into the helicopter cockpit. Everyone aboard died. I had my revenge.

As a police escort took me away, I saw Alfred Woden in a crowd of reporters. I knew he would hold his end of the deal.
