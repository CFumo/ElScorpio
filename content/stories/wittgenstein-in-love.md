His name was Ambrose and he was a lovesick fool. In the shade of a sycamore he carved his sweetheart’s initials in the thin bark. “How can I convey to you the depth of my affection?” he whispered. He carved a lopsided heart around her name. Then he carved an arrow piercing the heart. His brow furrowed. “Is it even possible to really communicate any emotion?” He pondered this morosely as he carved the little lines representing the fletches at the end of the arrow. Even the features of the arrow became abstracted as he attempted to portray them; dulled; meaningless. He felt as clumsy with his words as a five-year-old clutching a crayon. Maybe all expression was futile. Maybe even his love was meaningless, yet he couldn’t stop agonizing over her. He collapsed against the trunk of the tree, groaning. “God damnit… This fucking sucks…”

She was wakened by a seemingly frustrated man, seeking comfort by her side. Unsure of the man’s intentions, she waited, unmoving. Swiftly he grabbed a nearby rock and began to pierce into her bark, flaking away pieces of flesh. The pain struck her as nothing she’d felt before. Through the white blindness she heard him whisper… the depth of affection? She’d heard of this, stemming from an old tale, humans would wander into the woods, and cut into the trees, offering a sort of prayer so their love would spring eternal. Once again he sliced open the wood. This was her first devotee, he had chosen her because he thought she was worthy to protect his love and help it grow. Though the pain had almost rendered her incapacitated, she yearned to help the pining boy, but she was unable to communicate any real emotion. She rustled her leaves, trying to branch out and indicate that his plea had been heard. There was something beautiful about the boy’s struggle and the sappy, lopsided heart that was now a part of her morphology. She fought for the strength to leave the boy with peace, the pain, however, had an agonizing grip over her and the tree and the boy collapsed against each other, groaning. “God damnit… This fucking sucks…”
