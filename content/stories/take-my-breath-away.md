He held her, in his arms, delicately, waiting for her sobs to cease. *Shh... shh… it’ll be alright.* She was too absorbed in her misery to chastise him for his lie. He brushed back the wet strands of hair, tucking them behind her ear, and ran a finger softly down her neck. Her breath hitched and he could feel her pulse quicken beneath his finger. *Now. *She turned to him. *I’m ready. *He blinked at her in surprise. *Now? *She pulled back from him, to look him in the eye. He was surprised to find her gaze scathing. *Unless you don’t want to anymore. I could just find someone else... *Here words were meant to sting, and they did, a little. *I’m not going to be the only one who hasn’t-* He frowned at her. This wasn’t how it was supposed to go. Well, when he’d first met her it was all he had wanted, but they’d become friends since then. More than friends, really…*Please? *There was an infinite sadness behind her eyes, and he knew he couldn’t say no. *Okay. *He lifted her gently, shifting so he hovered above her. *Will it hurt? *She asked matter-of-factly. Fearlessly. *Only at first. *He leaned in and kissed her forehead, her nose, her lips, her neck. And then he gorged on the pulsing sliver of her throat. She was gone before she could scream.
