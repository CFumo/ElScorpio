First contact was smooth between humanity and the inhabitants of the β Lyrae world Kayatya. The Kayatyan are also terrestrial, heterotrophic, and use sound for communication, so the mission cryptographers made quick work of an Earth Standard – Shataktya translation, and trade policies and diplomatic protocol were established rapidly.

Relations proceeded amicably until a complement of human soldiers was hosted at the coronation party of a Kayatyan demi-monarch. Lieutenant Commander Risa Panadura commented that the meat served at the banquet was very tasty, and the demi-monarch's seventh son Akyat replied that the meat was from his brother's brood, and that their family was actually a little famous for its flavor and texture.

Panadura valiantly contained her revulsion as Akyat explained further. Human xenologers had puzzled over the apparent Kayatyan fecundity—a single parent spawning several dozen young at once—versus the unremarkable population growth. As it turned out, the Kayatyan culled seventy to ninety percent of their young in the late stages of infancy, and happily consumed the nutritious flesh.

The other humans were not as careful to conceal their disgust. Some became openly sick and had to be escorted to the washrooms. Petty Officers Luca Baldoni and Xiaoyan Wei were particularly outspoken, vehemently expressing their distaste with what they'd eaten. The Kayatyan were hard-pressed to understand the violence of the human reactions. Several native party-goers tried to explain that Kayatyan young are not considered fully conscious or sentient until about the end of their third year, well after the culling age. When Baldoni objected that the infants were still alive, Akyat pointed out that human mothers sometimes intentionally ejected young that were not developed enough to survive outside the womb, and that was not considered objectionable.

The situation was clearly building into a diplomatic emergency; Panadura tried to regain control of the crew, but the argument continued to escalate. Wei and Baldoni finally pulled out concealed automatic weapons and began firing into the crowd, Baldoni howling wordlessly and Wei repeatedly screaming, "They're just babies! They're just babies!" Several dozen Kayatyan were killed before the humans could be brought under control.
