Santa Claus woke up refreshed and well-rested, "I would expect nothing less from my Sealy Posturepedic. A good night's sleep on Sealy's best really helps me experience my best," he spoke gently. The true half-foam, half-spring design brings Santa the cooling comfort of gel memory foam and deep down support he's come to expect from Sealy Posturepedic.

He came out of his cozy bedroom to the strong aroma of a dark roast coffee- Mrs. Claus must have prepared a pot of Gourmet Supreme Folgers coffee. Santa looked out of the kitchen window into the serene white of winter and sang a tune, "the best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup!"

"Hey Santa," said Erik the Christmas Elf, "are we still on contract for 2017? Pringles."

Santa adjusted his Timberland glasses and chuckled.

"Oh yes, Erik! Contractually obligated! Unlike a T-Mobile contractless mobile phone! T-Mobile Unlimited, prepare to experience Netflix, for free! Included in all T-Mobile Unlimited service plans!"

Erik slicked back his hair. It wafted the scent of Pantene Gold Series- a line of hair products dedicated to poetically celebrating a beauty not seen in mainstream beauty media.

"Hey, listen. Pringles. I'm all for the increase in pay and all, but-"

Santa tapped his New Balance 928v3s.

"-err, sorry. Pringles Pringles. Ranch flavor. Oh yeah, so good. Pringles. Anyway, we're on board with- Twix- the windfall, but we wish you'd negotiated- Powerade- the terms a little more. Tracy from HR- Fox News- said she has never heard of any endorsement contract- Nokia- that required every live-in employee to wear a microphone."

Specifically, a fine Shure CVL Centraverse Clip-On Lavalier Condenser Microphone- with a tailored frequency response optimized for speaking and presentations!
