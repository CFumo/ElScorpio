Dear Santa

All I want for Christmas is a shit load of teeth! (I hope 'shit' is ok to use. I assume so. I bet you’re not an old-timey moralist. Those guys were diiiicks)

Anyway, I don’t want anything else. No new xbox, no tickets to Hawaii (as if!), no... socks! Please save whatever currency you convert my 'nice-ness' to and get me a bulk amount of bargain-priced human teeth.

Dude, I don't want dog teeth. I want straight up human teeth. No particular reason, either. I suppose I have an inkling to make an art thing out of them or something, but knowing my started project:finished project ratio... well, you know how it goes.

Straight up buckets of teeth. Enough to fill a bathtub!

I mean, honestly, I'm not really sure how much goodness I've been creating this year, so I'm not gonna be grouchy if I don't get a literal BATHTUB full of 'em. I wouldn't balk at a big jar of them.

Uhhh, I dunno if I have to list all the good things I did. Seems like you're a teleporting humanoid thing that, if real, has no concern for time and space. I bet you know my sins and virtues, so whatever. I hope slamming some mad sativa rippers and cold-messaging you isn't a deal-breaker. And, I guess, misusing stoner terms? I don't know if you're really into that green stuff.

P.S. Sending a little 'goodie bag' to grease your wheels, you red Rasta giant, you!

A few days ago I sent the above letter to 96930 Arctic Circle, etc etc. It was a Friday after a long week's worth of work and, yeah, I was pretty stony. And yeah, sending pot candy to Finland is probably a Very Bad Idea™ (not to mention the (quick) drive to the post office and a colorful conversation with my new friend, Ted the Mailman).

But, you know, I didn't even remember doing what I did. So, you can imagine my great surprise when a PALLET full of small-to-medium boxes loomed, like a monolith of shame, over my front door.

mery christmrnt 1/365

That was written on the shipping manifest attached to the tower.

By this time, the green fog lifted from my memory and I allowed my mind to run amok with wonder and joy. Santa is real! Magic is real! Holy shit, this may be a controlled delivery of ANYTHING illegal to help send me to federal jail for SENDING DRUGS TO FINLAND OH FUCK.

But, on second, thought, why would they send me so many boxes?

My fear turned back to joy turned to horror after I slit open one of the boxes from the top of the pile.

Teeth. Filled to the cardboard brim with teeth. The worst part was the type of teeth- it was all over the place. Tiny child teeth, worn, cavitied ones, teeth fragments, etc. Some even had foul-smelling flesh attached.

Where the fuck did the teeth come from?

Well, from Santa, I guess. That wasn't... I suppose that's a given. I was terrified by where Santa SOURCED the teeth from. Grave digging? God, I hope it was grave digging. I mean, I would prefer them to have come from ethical sources like... dentist schools? Is there a big pile of teeth they dump into? So many questions.

I spent an hour lugging all the boxes to my basement right away, lest anyone saw 500 pounds of human product in the entryway.

Oh you know what I forgot? The message. 1/365? Did that mean what I hoped it didn't mean?

Yeah, it did. The next day another set of boxes came through. It was larger than the last, but not by much.

Over the course of the week, my basement was filled with boxes. See, I thought they were all teeth, which would have been terrible in the first place, but I actually went through one shipment thoroughly. There was a kilo of what appeared to be cocaine.

gud shit ;) 100% f i s h s c a l e

Was written on the side of THAT particular gem. I could no longer report any of this to anyone official. Santa Claus was sending me 20K worth of drugs every DAY.

Oh, and the teeth. The teeth! I searched news sites for tooth-related keywords.

Yeah, it wasn't good. Countless stories from overseas mentioned incidents in rural villages in poor countries. Whole populations underwent minor blunt-force facial trauma and were missing their teeth. Thousands of bodies were exhumed from graveyards across the globe and beheaded. I knew where the teeth were going, BUT WHERE WERE THE HEADS!?

I'm a month into this horror. I've been sending Santa letters begging for him to stop, but all I get back is Return To Sender mail inexplicably filled with eggnog coupons.

Many of my friends, acquaintances, and strangers on the street have been getting tooth necklaces, so I guess it's not all bad?

Last night I got a special Express delivery. It was a bespoke wooden box with a note written on crumbling parchment:

bonus toth:elf enojoy !

Below, a certificate of authenticity and ownership, along with a small description fit for inclusion in a fantasy novel. Within a glass tessaract, atop a wisp of cloud lay a 6-inch serrated, wicked object. Less a tooth and more a kris. Inordinately heavy; it gave off an aura of hate.

I am afraid of this monster, this mythical Santa. I regret my arrogance and hope to never encounter an elf. My life is ruined and I don't know what the fuck is going on.
