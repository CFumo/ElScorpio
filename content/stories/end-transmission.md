Jen took the hand off of the magical crystal and began to glow herself. Don was flabbergasted. They died in an explosion of great power. Sarah was far away from the events. She was a schoolgirl. Half a pound of uranium stuck from her forehead- a grand cancer unicorn. Sarah knew how to party in college. She set up hundreds of lightshows for her unsuspecting victims. She, of course, was the biggest unsuspecting victim of all. Never getting laid because of the whole cancer thing, her sexual frustrations were taken out on her brigade of oversized dildos. The nights were spent being berated by their mocking voices. She was insane, after all. Sarah was completely insane. She didn’t ACTUALLY have a fissile material embedded in her skull. That would give HER cancer too! What she had was a bad case of psychosis. Fortunately for her peers, the madness didn’t manifest in violent outbursts

Excerpt:

Here cums Santa Claws,

Here cums Santa Claws,

Right down Santa Claws Lane,

Trixy and Bubbles and all his reindeer

Pullin' on the vens.

Balls are ringin', children squealin’,

All is sexy and bright.

So wank your cock and yiff your prayers,

'Cause Santa Claws cums tonight.

Here cums Santa Claws,

Here cums Santa Claws,

Right down Santa Claws Lane,

He’s got a dirty bag of filth

For the young fuzzbutts.

Listen to his grunts.

How stark, the sickening countenance of his haggard face

Run away! He comes. He will come and cum.

Santa Claws cums tonight.

Here cums Santa Claws,

Here cums Santa Claws,

Right down Santa Claws Lane,

He schemes the dark thoughts,

No day of reprieve.

All of Earth will end in a conflagration of skin.

Cry out for your gods,

They cannot help you.

'Cause Santa Claws cums tonight.

Here cums Santa Claws,

Here cums Santa Claws,

Right down Santa Claws Lane,

Space rapist, the Santa.

Agony prevails, his tyrant body compelled by a dark seed inside.

An onslaught of hate, a force to be feared,

Happiness just a myth in his world.

The people dressed as animals are the only ones spared,

'Cause Santa Claws cums tonight.

They are lulled into a false sense of superiority. Indeed, they think they have been spared.

But Santa Claws only toys with them. He has left them for last, the miniscule pawns orders of magnitude below him.

Infinite power makes him drunk and mad. Fusing their human skin to their polymer costumes.

Such fools, to have thought their ties to the animal kingdom gave them a leg up over the competition.

Survival of the species, and the Rapex Predator is beyond the imagination.

'Cause Santa Claws cums tonight.

and she lived an otherwise harmless life. Sarah dealt with her issues by herself for a very long time. She ended up with a good partner who took care of her and saw the need to have her see a specialist. Sarah was taken to several doctors during her long relationship with Mandy Delgado and ended up living a relatively fulfilling life. This isn’t about Sarah and Mandy, though. This is ACTUALLY about Thomas. He never knew Sarah. He never knew Mandy. He had heard of no Jen, nor Don. Thomas didn’t know or hear about anyone, in fact. He was born with a disease that didn’t allow him to form thoughts of remembering. He also had no ears- a congenital problem. His parents were very worried because they were very young and Thomas was born due to their negligence in bed. ¯\_()_/¯. It happens, though. It wasn’t a massive problem, as they both had good support groups. Thomas’ early life was taken care of. He became a really good writer and wrote really good stories. This could have been one of them, if not for the fact that he only wrote in non-English languages. Had a huge knack for learning different tongues. Except English. Too much trouble to be put into a globalized economy. If you don’t know English, you’re DEFINITELY not going to create trade agreements between world superpowers. Thomas died in 1987 after 50 years of living in Guatemala. He wasn’t from there, though. His parents were from Iowa, USA. American made, just like the cars Thomas always drove. There was a certain kinship between him and the metal steeds of the Greatest Superpower on Earth. Until, of course, Toyota took the automotive world by storm. This story isn’t about Thomas, actually. It IS about the other people, but the wool has been pulled over the eyes of the Dear Reader. This way and that- the narrative is a tennis match. Reader is just really slow on uptake. Good luck with life, FOOL. Nothing in the world is free. Not even your vile, commercial entertainment.
