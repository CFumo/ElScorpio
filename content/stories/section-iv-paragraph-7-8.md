Simupod Mk. III has been shown to cause headaches, loss of appetite, ennui, involuntary shudders, depression, sudden vomiting, high sex drive, suicidal ideations, and rashes. Talk to a medical professional if any of these side effects occur during or after the use of Simupod Mk. III.

In some rare cases, the user may experience a full sensory shift and be unable to tell the difference between reality and simulation. If this occurs, the user may wait until the Simupod Mk. III enters auto-sleep mode. In the extremely rare cases of sleep mode malfunction, the user may perform the following steps:

1. Ensure the sensory input experienced is, in fact, virtual.

1a. Locate the nearest light.

1b. Look at the light.

1c. Close eyes.

1d. Place an opaque, solid material in front of eyes. A hand will suffice.

2. If the brightness does not change, the user is in a simulation. Rendering lights is disabled when the userâ€™s eyes are obstructed.

3. Kill self.

4. Awaken from the simulation.
