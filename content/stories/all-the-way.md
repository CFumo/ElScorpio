It was by almost dream-like circumstance that Z found himself transfixed by the plump derri√®re before him thinking, "I have never in my life been so turned on and turned off simultaneously."

Z had been courting S for three months so getting her naked was the thing of fantasies. She was a huge flirt and they'd done stuff but wasn't til tonight that he'd been bold enough to go for it. Actually, that had been her doing. "I wanna do you tonight," she'd cooed.

Z didn't need telling twice and had promptly scooped S off her feet and carried her upstairs. Undressing her was a slow and sensual affair. As each new patch of skin was revealed, he'd caress it slowly and kiss it.

When S had told him to flip her over so he could do her from behind, Z nearly lost it. But then there it was. Tattooed on S's butt was an awful looking demon creature. Z could only presume it to be female because, well, it's parts were aligned with S's.

S turned her head to look back at Z. "What's wrong baby? Oh, did you meet M?" S waggled her butt back and forth. "She wants it too. Come on baby, I want to feel you inside me so bad."

Z eyed the creature before closing his eyes and plunging into S. She was wet and warm and he could feel her muscles grip him tightly. But then it was too warm. Z opened his eyes as a pair of hard clawed hands gripped his waist. There was M in all her awful glory, exactly where S had been. Z's scream was drowned out by her orgasm.
