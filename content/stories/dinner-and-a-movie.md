All suburban youth are vampires. Including myself.

I remember first seeing The Pack as they floated into the movie parlour and drained the life out of that poor theatre employee. Left him convulsing on the salt and sugar floor. The blood poured thick and black from the fresh holes in his neck and got sucked up by the God-awful maroon pattern carpets. I can still see that funny look in his eye and the way his feet twitched in his shiny black shoes after he drew his final breath.

It all unfolded so fast, so nonchalant. I was standing in line for the picture show. I forget which one. Maybe it was that one where Matthew McConaughey goes into space. That doesn't really matter. What matters is that it was the first time I spied The Pack. The Seven of them. Preening, sinister, beautiful. Oh they were a sight to behold! The first thing I noticed with mine keen eye was just how tall they all were - at least 6 foot 5 each and thin as rails. And their skin - alabaster, like a full moon's gleam. Their black lips jumped off of their faces. Lips that were always smirking. I couldn't tell if they were male or female. They all had androgynous features: high cheek bones, long slicked-back hair - jet black, nimble fingers, and mid-sized chests and shoulders. I couldn't differentiate between them; they glided across the landscape together, as if all part of the same skulking creature.

So The Pack entered the movie parlour. And I was instantly smitten. I loved them all. I wanted to be with them. But I knew that they were Untouchable to me. Their mission was sacred and unknown. I was hopelessly uninvolved and never would be. So I gazed from afar as they made their silent way to the concession stand and that poor unsuspecting theatre employee.

"Would you like some popcorn?" the young obese little worker queried.

The tallest of that tall Pack looked to the others for consensus, and in a matter-of-fact silver tone whispered, "No. We would like your life force."

"I'm sorry, my what?"

"Life force. Your soul's energy. We would like it."

"Well, uh, I don't think I can give you that. But we do have Junior Mints. Do you like those?"

The Seven widened their eyes and in perfect unison launched a scathing HISSSSSSSSSS

"Hey. What's the big deal? I'm just trying to make suggestions."

"You can fight, but your life force will be ours."

"I think I better get my manager. He'll be able to help you out."

The rotund fella swiveled around in a move to leave, but he hadn't walked two steps before The Pack had him surrounded - Seven anthropophagus Bloodbottler giants surrounding their prey.

"I told you I don--- gah!"

The Pack backed yon hopeless employee against the nearest wall with a movie poster of Will Ferrell in a purple Speedo and began to methodically puncture holes in his neck with their incisors. The blood squirted everywhere - the ground, the worker, Ferrell's exposed thighs - everywhere except on members of The Pack. They remained immaculate.

At this juncture, I was hiding behind a cardboard cut-out of Robert Downey, Jr. promoting Iron Man 65 and staring in rapture. These vampires were merciless. It was a revelation. My inners were in jubilation at such expressionless efficiency at work. It was a holy experience that I had been given the privilege to witness.

The Pack left as elegantly as it arrived. No trail of blood. A trail of whispered jubilation. I slipped out from behind Mr. Downey and strolled behind the concession counter. I poured myself some popcorn from the popcorn maker. Salt and butter. What a glorious show. I wondered what would open next week at the box office. Then I called an Uber and went to my cave, enlightened.
