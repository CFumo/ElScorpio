I was always Gran Samuel’s favorite daughter, so it is no wonder that his spirit watches over me and my family after his passing two years ago.

He lived generously—donating regularly, taking care of the neighborhood families that lacked. Sam was a good man with a deep, endearing laugh. He was a hard worker and earned all he had through blood, sweat, and tears, but he never balked at sharing the fruits of his labor. He was in a loving, committed relationship with Gramma for over 50 years. When she died, he was devastated, but redoubled his efforts to help others.

My immediate family didn’t grow up with much, but Gran Sam was always there to help. When Dad worked the Kodiak-based trowler for a whole season and Mom was pulling double shifts at PeaceHealth Southwest Urgent Care, my brothers and I were always in good hands with our grandpa.

When I met John and had my own kids, Gran Sam gave us the freedom to travel every once in awhile by house sitting and making sure the kids and dogs didn’t get into too much trouble. My life always felt secure when he was around. Not only because of his financial and time generosity, but because of his size and strength. Once, when walking through a local park, Sam, the kids, and I were accosted by two drug addicts. I was terrified—one of them was carrying a pipe and they were screaming for us to hand over our money. Gran Sam didn’t bat an eye at these criminals. He stepped between us and them and dared the two to fight. I guess they saw the danger in his eyes and his large biceps, because they ran away. He just turned to me, smiled, and said, “I’ll never let anything happen to you, lambkin. I’ll always protect you and keep you close.” He took me in his arms and hugged me and kissed my head until my terror tears stopped coming. He was my big, loving, protector.

Only a year after the attempted mugging, Gran Sam succumbed to an extremely aggressive brain cancer. We were all blindsided. He started telling us that he could smell things that weren’t there. That wasn’t concerning until my brother Rick mentioned it in passing to a nurse he was dating. She immediately had Gran Sam get an MRI, as that’s a classic sign of brain tumors.

His death came quickly after that. The powerful man I had grown up loving as much, if not more than my own father turned into a shell of his former self. The last few months were a kaleidoscope of pain and misery for him; the brain tumors weaving into his memories and sensations.

Three months after his death, I felt him. I knew it was him because I felt an enveloping warmth and pressure on my head during a moment of grief. John had recently left me and I was often in a state of shock and misery. But I knew Sam was there, comforting and loving me.

It took several months for the reality of the situation to sink in, but it was clear that my grandfather was always close at hand even after death. I was elated! My Gran Sam was back and he protected the people I loved most. I constantly felt his aura of warmth and kindness and knew that I could still rely on him.

Unfortunately, I now have a different feeling about his presence. Yesterday, on the second anniversary of his death, my sister Hannah and I got a little drunk and started talking about the past. I mentioned that I knew Gran Sam was around and Hannah burst into tears.

She said, “I knew he was around. I’ve felt the clammy sensation of his presence ever since I got here. You know he raped us, right?”

I was in shock.

“He used to wait until Rick and I were asleep and touch us. I know he made Rick kiss him and suck him. When Mom and Dad were away, he fucked me. Almost every time. He fucked me, Ellen. Didn’t he do the same to you?” Hannah looked desperately at me, a look of betrayal on her face, “Didn’t he molest you too, Ellen?”

I spent the day calling other members of the family. Sure enough, most talked about Gran Sam’s “little secret.” I had no idea. I had no clue and I don’t know why he spared me. I am scared of being home and feeling his presence now. I question everything in the last two years. I noticed my kids quickly grew up and became distant after Gran Sam died. I had always thought they missed him. They told me they knew Gran Sam was around, but they didn’t want to talk about it at length. They always looked a little morose when I waxed poetic about the latest encounter with him. My guardian angel is my child-raping grandfather. He watches me and my kids as we sleep. I hope that’s all he does… Oh my god…
