“Say Clem, what you reckon this thing is?”

Eli held his pan across the water for Clem to inspect. Nestled in the silt was a strange, colorful object.

Clem took a long drag on his joint and blearily eyed the contents of the pan.

“Well… it sure ain’t gold.”

“No shit jackass,” said Eli, as Clem doubled over with laughter. “Now hand over the spliff, it’s your turn to work this thing.”

Clem pulled the ray gun from the pan while Eli puffed indolently on their marijuana cigarette.

“Heh! Looks like something’ outta one of them ‘moon man’ stories,” he said. He turned it over in his hands until he found the trigger. He gave it an experimental squeeze, but nothing happened.

Eli began coughing heavily from the other side of the stream. Clem grinned.

“Awww, wouldja look at Johnny Newcome over here, smokin’ his first lil’ marijuana cigarette,” he heckled.

“Shut yer trap, ya hog,” wheezed Eli. “Phew! This stuff sure packs a wallop!”

Unbeknownst to our intrepid stoner forty-niners, this conversation was taking place on the date of a momentous occasion in human history. At 4:17 AM on April 2, 1849, the first ship of an invading extraterrestrial fleet broke atmosphere over Coldwater Lake in Alberta, Canada. Subsequent ships descended throughout the Pacific Northwest. The first shots between humans and aliens were exchanged by 6:02 AM.

In Salem, Oregon on the same day, local recluse Grover Moses Miller performed an occult ritual behind his cabin, mistakenly opening a portal to hell at 5:45 AM. Demons erupted from the portal and flooded the surrounding area within minutes. They spread rapidly in all directions.

Back at the creek, Clem bent down with the pan at the water’s edge.

“Here,” he said, and tossed the ray gun to Eli, who put his hands out seconds after the gun dropped past him. Clem hooted with laughter as Eli fished clumsily for the gun. A noise from the nearby brush made them freeze and lock eyes.

“Someone’s comin’!” hissed Eli.

“Quick, hide the reefer!”

Eli snuffed out the stub of their joint in the sand.

A demon trundled out of the woods; man-shaped, but hunched and hulking, and covered in leathery skin. Gore-spattered tusks rose from a wrinkled snout, and it glared at the miners with dead-man’s eyes.

Clem and Eli stared back, wide-eyed, until the creature gave a loud, porcine snort. They burst into peals of hearty laughter.

“Looks like the hog got out the barn again!” cried Eli, cackling and clutching Clem for support. The demon bared its fangs before lunging toward them.

“Whoa there!” said Clem. He tried to sidestep but tripped and fell. The demon sailed over him and landed in the creek with a splash. Clem and Eli hooted with laughter.

“Try again, Junior!” hollered Clem, and smacked himself on the rear. Eli chuckled along as he held a match up to light his joint.

The beast thrashed to its feet and charged back toward them. A loud crack split the air, and the demon’s head exploded mid-stride. Clem and Eli looked around and saw a woman shouldering a smoking Winchester. She lowered the rifle and made a hasty sign of the cross.

“You there!” she said, and the miners jumped to attention. “Were you fools just planning to stand there and let the devil gore you? Don’t you know there’s a war on? Satan’s minions are upon us at this very moment, and if there’s a Christian bone in your body you’ll take up arms and fight!”

Clem and Eli stared, thunderstruck.

“And put that out this instant!” said the woman. “Smoking is a filthy habit and I won’t tolerate it.”

She plucked the joint out of Eli’s mouth. “Hey, c’mon!” he said.

The woman’s eyes narrowed and she sniffed the spliff. Her expression turned to one of disgust and outrage.

“Oh my Lord Jesus, you’ve been smoking the devil’s weed. No wonder you’re useless!” She lobbed the spliff into the creek. Eli reached for it reflexively, then turned back to her with a sullen expression.

“We need to secure a perimeter,” she continued. “You two stay and patrol this area while I scout for a more defensible position.” She stalked off, muttering to herself.

When she returned to the creek, she heard an unfamiliar voice.

“Look, just give me back the gun and I’ll leave.”

Clem and Eli were talking to a naked, grey-skinned man with a huge head and huge black eyes.

“Seems like it’s busted anyway,” said Clem. “I tried givin’ it a squeeze already and it didn’t do shit.”

“That’s because you need to thumb the safety first,” said the alien. “But it won’t work for you anyway, there’s a bioscanner in the thumb slot. Just...hand it over, alright?”

“Not another word, imp,” said Annie, leveling her rifle at the alien.

“Whoa, look lady, I’m not one of them,” it said, holding up its hands. “Please, just lower your weapon.”

She jabbed a finger at it. “You can’t fool me, devil.”

“Seriously?” it said with a glare. “You humans should have gotten over this centuries ago! Listen: There is no god. There is no afterlife. Ghosts don’t exist.”

“If there’s no hell, then how do you explain these creatures?” asked Annie.

“They’re probably just extra-dimensional beings. It’s common on planets with this gravity profile.” It gave a watery sigh. “Ohhh, this invasion is a disaster.”

There was a rustling from the underbrush, and six more demons stalked forward.

“Ah jeez, just gimme the gun!” begged the alien.

As Annie fired on the first demon, Clem aimed the ray gun, thumbed the safety, and fired. A jet of red light shot from the gun and sheared the branch off a nearby tree.

“Hot damn!” said Eli, smacking his thigh.

“Oh no,” groaned the alien. “The THC in their drug must be fooling the bioscanner.”

“This is some pea shooter, Moon Man!” cried Clem. He fired again and incinerated a stone in the creek bed.
