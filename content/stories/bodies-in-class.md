Smothered in numbers and lines and questions, I struggle for a reason to breathe. And being young and human and animal, I visualize him. I gasp. How amazing it is to recognize the dreadful yearning of my body and breathe again. His lips, his face, his eyes, his arms…In that white t-shirt with black striping down the side that lines the contours of his body; the sleeves wrap tightly around his biceps. Strong. Stronger than I realized at first, but I learned. The pressure he applied to my skin and muscles with a force that begged us to never let go. I wish I held him longer.

And I will lose him. I can’t have something so wonderfully thoughtless right now. It would distract me from those numbers, the ones encroaching on my dream as the droning lines go on and on and question my attention. With that, I’ve already lost the lovely picture. How easily the concrete destroys the better fantasies. One voice is enough to shatter an entire world.
