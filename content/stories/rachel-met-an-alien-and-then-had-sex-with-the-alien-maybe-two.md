It was 9pm, but Rachel Older decided this was as good a time as any to go for a jog. She stepped out of her mansion made of diamonds, very thankful that her acres of land allowed her to safely go for a run whenever she pleased. Her armies of guards were positioned strategically to keep the zombie hordes at bay and off her property.

She had been running for nearly twenty minutes. She glistened with sweat, and her nipples were becoming very irritated. She rubbed them in attempt to soothe them when she saw it. It looked like a dog. No, a wolf. No, maybe it's a large dog. It's orange though. It was a big orange wolf dog. The wolf dog made eye contact with her. He began to walk away, looking back as if beckoning her to follow. So she did. "I'm gonna pet that fucking wolf dog," Rachel muttered to herself.

Dodging through trees, Rachel finally found the wolf dog sitting and waiting for her. Next to him was another wolf dog. This one looked a little more like a dog. It was still kinda like a wolf, but less wolf. More dog. Also it was bright Magenta. "Oh, FUCK YEAH." Rachel said.

But that's where things got hazy. A brilliantly bright light engulfed Rachel from above. All she could see through the pillar of light was the glow of the wolf dog and sorta wolf dog's eyes. ".......Fuck." Rachel yelled.

Rachel woke up naked on a table in a white, glowing room. This wasn't very strange for her. She was already naked when she went for her run, but usually she woke up under tables, not on them.

"GREETINGS, HUMAN." a disembodied voice boomed throughout the room. "OH MY GOD." Rachel replied without thinking. She laughed at her own inanity. At the other end of the room was the wolf dog and the sorta wolf dog, but this time they also had a friend with them. It was another dog, but this one was even more wolf. It was basically a wolf. Also he's green. But, like, a cool green. "YEAH! I LIKE THAT ONE!" Rachel yelled, pointing violently at the green wolf.

"Ok..." the orange wolf dog replied. "I suppose you're wondering why we brought you here."

Rachel shrugged. She had not been wondering that.

The orange wolf dog explained anyway. "We are a race of what your people might call... ALIENS! From a distant planet! Our species has survived for MILLENIA, but we are looking for ways to better our already perfect race. You humans have been selected as our perfect match. With our heads and your 'hands' we can give ourselves head scratchies whenever we please. We want head scratchies. Head scratchies remind us we are good boys."

The magenta sorta dog wolf whimpered and pawed at the orange wolf dog.

"and good girls." the orange wolf dog corrected.

"FUCK YEAH, BRING IT ON!" Rachel yelled, slamming the area around her vagina with her hands. She had never been more ready for anything in her life.

"YOU ARE NOT YET READY" boomed the orange wolf dog. A door opened behind him, and twenty or so animals of varying wolf to dog ratio poured into the room. OH MAN, THAT ONE KINDA LOOKS LIKE A BEAR. YEAH!

A beam shot out from a machine above the door, hitting Rachel directly in her vagina. Her vagina began to expand. "You will take all of us. Make us many children." the orange wolf dog commanded.

"Wait... I will only have romantic sex with one alien... or two aliens..." Rachel argued.

Hearing this, the green mostly wolf dog lept onto the table. He sat down between her legs, staring directly into her eyes. A single tear fell down Rachel's face.  "I've been waiting my whole life for this moment." The green mostly wolf dog wiped the tear from her face as best he could with his little doggy paw. "Shhh. We will make love. May we remember this moment for the rest of our lives."

Rachel cupped her mouth and stroked the fur of his neck. She couldn't hold back tears of joy, but also wondered how long the mostly wolf dog would live since larger breeds tend to have shorter life spans, but whatever.

The green mostly wolf dog licked the tears from her face. His four penises began to grow and snake around Rachel's legs towards her vagina, stopping just before the entrance of her moist, womanly cove. Looking her directly in her eyes as his head lay on her chest, he asks "Are you ready, m'lady?"

Rachel was now convinced the green mostly wolf dog was some sort of space knight and that made this SO MUCH HOTTER. She released a sharp gasp as one of the penises entered her delicate meat muffin and the other three entered her anus.  Green mostly wolf dog nuzzled his face against hers while his little doggy hands fondled her boobs gently. "Is this good for you?" he whispered, the warmth of his breath tingling on her ear.  A weak "yes" was all Rachel could muster.  She had not previously known this level of ecstasy was even possible.

The other aliens had been watching this entire scene.  They openly wept at the beauty transpiring before them. The orange wolf dog let out a howl and said "WE HAVE STUDIED AND TRAVELED TO FIND WHAT EVOLUTION HAD LEFT US LACKING. IN THE END, THE HUMANS HAVE SHOWN US THE TRUTH. IT WAS LOVE ALL ALONG."

When Rachel and the green mostly wolf dog had finished, they laid on the table and cuddled for what felt like days. "Come with us. Come back to my home planet." The green mostly wolf dog's tail made loud thuds as it wagged excitedly and hit the table.

"Nah... I WANNA HAVE SEX WITH A LION NEXT! OR A DEER BOY!  IT'S A BOY WHO ALSO TRANSFORMS INTO A DEER!"

*Prompt, Rachel Older: "Please write a romantic sex scene between a human and an alien, or two aliens." *
