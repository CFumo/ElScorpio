Harriet loved going into her kitchen because all of her appliances were alive. She got home from work on a Wednesday and called her normal greeting into the dark kitchen.

“Hey guys, I’m home!” she said, flipping the light switch.

There was blood all over the countertop. Steve the Stove was dead. Mary the Microwave was trembling uncontrollably, and Fred the Fridge had big frosty tears leaking out of his ice dispenser.

\*\*\*

“And you didn’t see *anything*?”

Harriet adjusted the spotlight. It was pointing directly at Fred’s face. He’d been moved into the corner of the living room and was still sniffling a little.

“Like I said,” he blubbered, “it was so dark and it all happened so fast, have you tried talking to Mary? She was closer when it happened than I was.”

“I already talked to Mary,” said Harriet. “I want to know who did it and why you guys are protecting them!”

Harriet threw down her notepad in disgust and went back to the crime scene. She already knew who did it. She’d seen the blade marks on the body. It was Billy the Blender. What she didn’t know was why everyone else was protecting him. What were they hiding? She heard the front door squeak shut. Then she heard the blender motor roar to life in the living room. *Shit*. She pulled out her gun and slowly crept around the corner.
