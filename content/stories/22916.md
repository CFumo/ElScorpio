I don't want to get into this vulnerable place, where the words on the page are a window in my brain. I don't want to write about longing to be cherished, when you might guess it's a thinly veiled narrative of my deepest wish. I don't want to create a woman who is searching for her place in the world; how will she find it if I haven't found my own? So I'll write about robots, old men, and space and maybe you'll believe this smile on my face.
