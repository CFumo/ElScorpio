Neo put his head in his hands and groaned.

"Man, how am I gonna get Trinity to go out with me?"

He was slumped at the kitchen table while Morpheus stood at the stove. Morpheus's cat walked by, rubbing himself against Neo's leg as he went.

"Do you know what kind of food she likes?" asked Morpheus. "Why don't you ask her out to dinner?"

“I don’t know what kind of food she likes because I’m too intimidated to talk to her.”

Mouse jumped up from the couch, pulled his headphones down around his neck, and slumped into the chair beside Neo.

“Face it dude,” he said, “she’s just too cool for you.”

“Mouse…” Morpheus scolded.

Mouse shot him a look, and then shot a look at the stove. “Tasty Wheat again? Man Morpheus, how can you eat that stuff?”

“Everything the body needs,” said Morpheus. The phone rang and he went to go answer it.

Mouse peered at Neo. “Look man, if you’re just looking to get some action, I’ve got this friend…”

“It’s not about that,” said Neo. “I’ve never met anyone like her. She rooted a Citibank server in under five minutes!”

“Dozer wants to play Poker tonight,” Morpheus called from the other room. Morpheus’s cat walked by, rubbing himself against Neo’s leg as he went.

“Don’t beat yourself up about it, dude,” said Mouse. “Plenty of other fish in the sea.”

“I dunno man,” said Neo. “I think she’s The One.”

Morpheus walked up, pressed his hands into the table, and leaned forward.

“Stop trying to date her and date her.”
