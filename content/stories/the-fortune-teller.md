Brenna had always wanted to go to a fortune teller. She wasn't particularly superstitious, but she was certainly fearful of the future. If she could get a little help, a bit of a heads up, why not try it out? So, on her 26th birthday, she decided to treat herself to a session. Brenna did extensive online research before finding Celeste. There were dozen of reviews touting her skill.

“Celeste is pure magic. She predicted the exact day and location I met my future husband!”

“I go to Celeste on the regular. She gives me an overview of my upcoming month. It helps with my anxiety.”

“Celeste is omnipotent. She must be God.”

Brenna wasn't sure how she felt about that last one but booked an appointment anyway. She used a fake name to ensure Celeste couldn't Google her ahead of time.

When Brenna arrived at Celeste’s office, she wasn't surprised to find it dimly lit and heavily draped with translucent tapestry. It was right out of her imagination, as was Celeste’s delicate handshake and dreamy voice.

“Hello my lovely. Please, come sit. Let me look at you. No need to be worried dear, I won't disappoint you. You mustn't draw things out this way though. Your expectations put too much pressure on the outcome. Ahh yes, now let me absorb your energy.”

Celeste closed her eyes then waved her hands up, down, and around Brenna’s face and torso, never close enough to touch her. She hummed a soothing low melody. Then, she grabbed a pen and began scribbling across a notepad in front of her. She quickly folded it up, stuck it in an envelope, and handed it to Brenna.

“To read later. Once you've gotten home. You'll see why. Now let's see. Ava, what would you like to know?”

Brenna hesitated. “Well first, my name is actually Brenna. I...didn't feel like using my real name.”

“Mmm. Names are bestowed upon us. They can shape who we are if we let them. But that does not mean they're us. So what would you like to know?”

“Um. Okay. I guess...my future? I didn't realize I'd get to choose.” Brenna fiddled with the tassels on the pillow she was sitting on. What did she want to know? Who did she marry? How many kids would they have? What did her career look like? When would her parents die? When would she die? Would she be happy when she died?

“Oh, that's much too much,” Celeste chuckled. “Let's start off with the worst, shall we? Brenna, love, you are going to die alone. You will find love, but it will be short lived and your mourning will prevent you from seeing the other options in front of you.”

Brenna’s mouth dropped open in horror. “Aren't you-aren't you supposed to tell me good things? Fortunes?”

“You'd be skeptical if I only told you good things because you know that life isn't full of just good things. Besides, the future is of this moment. It is only valid for the person sitting before me. Change who she is and you change the outcome of your life.”

Brenna stood up, shaking her head. Why was this woman messing with her? “No. What a scam. You haven't said anything that proves this is real.”

A slight smile crossed Celeste’s lips. “This first one is on me so you don't feel like you've wasted your money. We’ll be in touch.”

Brenna quickly left and drove home, disappointed. As she removed the keys from her coat, she found Celeste’s envelope in her pocket. It had been a peculiar moment, and Brenna couldn't resist the temptation to open it.

My dear Brenna, Please do not be too upset about what I have said. You came to me looking for guidance, but I can only give you glimpses of what is to come. It is up to you to decide what choices to make that will shape your life. You may not experience grand, decades old love but you will have other things. You'll be a CFO. You'll adopt two wonderful children. You'll have weekly gatherings with your closest girl friends. You'll travel the world. When you're old you'll move into a retirement home with Rhea, as you have joked about.

You still have time to change your life, to get that “great love.” But remember, there are trade offs. It's in your hands.

Brenna reached for her phone just as it began to ring.

“Why don't we check in next month,” the voice on the other line asked.

“Yes,” Brenna replied, voice quivering, “does the 6th work?”
