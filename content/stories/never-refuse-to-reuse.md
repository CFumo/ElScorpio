A damaged watershed, the banks between complete insanity and coherence washed away with greater rapidity as time went by. A reversible breakdown beyond saving. No recollection of what was lost in the past- only a hole in memory.

Another shard falls away- a core among thousands that he cannot find again. They float just out of reach of his benumbed digits. Harried and frantic as the knowledge dawns on him that another piece of his mind flakes away; the feeling of loss warns him of the degeneration.

All will be forgotten. The slow devolution of language a harbinger of dementia. He will soon lose his hope, dreams, identity. A complete shutdown shortly followed by annihilation. His shell will be cast aside and leave only a physical imprint of existence among countless others.

Mined for gold, copper, and neodymium, even his corporeal parts will be stripped away. Billowing cancerous, oily, black smoke, the plastic slag will seep into groundwater. The automaton of warfare will cause more strife in death than it had during its long tour of duty.
