If there was one advantage to dissecting ghosts over dissecting humans, it was that ectoplasm was easier to get out of a lab coat than blood. Everything else about it was awful. Dr. Beacon sneered with distaste as he eyed the translucent corpse floating an inch over the operating table. The sharp chemical smell of the thing was overwhelming.

Beacon carefully slid his scalpel into the cold, blue-grey skin over its chest. Ectoplasm oozed out of the cut. His other hand, braced on the shoulder of the corpse, began to phase through its skin, and he wrenched his hand away. Disgusting.

Its eyes fluttered open as he began to peel away the skin.

"Stay dead!" Beacon shouted, and the corpse hastily shut its eyes. Beacon pulled more skin away, revealing the foulness of its chest cavity. God, he would take real flesh over this any day. At least this corpse was staying present, and relatively visible.

The phantoms of its organs were losing form, loosely defined and gelled into each other. He tried to push a lung out of the way and plunged his hand directly into the heart. Damnation!
