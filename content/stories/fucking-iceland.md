If you do Iceland right:

You'll see lots.

You'll fuck lots.

You'll spend lots and lots and lots.

Oh, and if you don't like the weather, fuck you. Pansy ass bitch. I'll give you something to complain about if you don't shut up. That's what I thought, geez.

Here's a guide on interacting with the locals:

Maintain a relaxed posture. Crouch if necessary.

Approach slowly and steadly.

Make cooing noises if you think it helps.

Allow them to sniff your hand but don't let it hover, they might think it's food and bite.

Pet them but be careful, they'll scratch you as soon as they get bored of it.

If you do Iceland wrong:

You'll die of intoxication.

You'll die of exposure.

You'll die of standing in the middle of the fucking road, you idiot. We still have cars, you know.

How to see lots

1. Rent a car. Buy a car. I don't know, steal a car. Do it, (the renting part. don't steal, hippie) from a local who's renting out personally because they won't fuck you over if you scratch the fucking thing. You're going to scratch the fucking thing, this place is the middle of nowhere and you're going to hit gravel. If you really want to do it "the proper way" (pinkies up!) then get the full insurance pronto. NO BUTS!

2. Do the Golden Circle. It's nice, it's a classic and it's easy if you're not a fucking moron at simple directions. If you didn't do #1 (in which case, what the fuck), then there's a bunch of tour bu$$e$ that can take you. If you think you need a tour guide, then get one. I don't recommend for or against, but I mean, it's all online innit.

3. Snæfellsnes, on the other hand, pretty much requires a tour guide. It's pretty damn amazing and filthy rich in that sweet, pungent history. You will go the peninsula even if you hate glaciers. Also why do you hate nature? Who in the world would hate glaciers, is there something wrong with you?

4. The Westfjords are the life, the soul, the beauty, the quintessential Iceland. Nobody regrets going there. Nobody! I'm telling you, it's bloody amazing! Anywhere you go, it'll be breathtaking and interesting as shit! But don't go in the winter, or you'll die. Summer is nice. It has blueberries. Lots of museums, too, if you're into that.

5. Jökulsárlón (pronounced joh-kuls-blah-blah) is alright. It's a glacial lagoon with floating icebergs. Lots of wildlife around, too, despite the massive massive amount of tourists. (become one today, apply within) That's a day trip, and you'll go through a few towns if you're heading there from rEkjaikv. First one, Hveragerði. Pretty nice little town, got its name from the hot springs around. Good hiking in the vicinity. Next up is Selfoss. The world's most boring town. You can entirely skip it. There's a neat waterfall shortly after that everyone goes see. waterfall4u bby. Vík í Mýrdal you'll want to visit at least a little bit. It's got.. things. Short bit from it there's Dyrhólaey, a cool promontory. Don't die ok. After that it's just straight path to Jökulsárlón. But I mean, there's cool things. Skaftafell is a pretty sight. Like, if you really were to explore the entire area, it'll take forever. Literally, forever, there's just so much.

6. If you continue on from Jökulsárlón you can go on to see gorgeous and beautiful East. Don't die ok.

7. That's it. Well, there's the North. It has the smug bastards from Akureyri. Fuck those smug freaks. Think they're so smug... Yeah I see you Akureyrians!

8. Accomodations are always full, but you can camp for $20 per night at campgrounds with like, some service, maybe, if you're lucky. AND YEAH IT'S EXPENSIVE I KNOW OH MY GOD SHUT UP. There's also these Airbnbs things? The economics of that is shady af tho but whatevs. can kill capitalism for all I care. Or support it, i dont know. That shit‘s hardly reported income tho.

How to fuck lots

1. Go downtown.

2. Fuck.

3. Lots.

How to spend lots and lots and lots

1. Well this is pretty easy. Because we're an island and we have taxes on literally everything, everything is expensive. So no matter what you do, you're pretty much fucked.

2. You can't avoid it. If you don't drink alcohol, you loser, then I guess you'll save a small amount and don't have to worry too much.

3. If you can manage a controlled burnrate we're still looking at excesses of $80 a day. Ok maybe you can keep it to $50, but I don't fucking know how. If you manage tell me ok. Also grant me 3 wishes, you fucking genie.

How not to die

1. You'd think this would be simple, but nah. The single most important thing you need here, is some good god damn fucking clothing, y'nasty bitch. Water's good too. Don't forget to bring some. You can actually get lost here. It's tiny place, but you can easily die. Don't die ok. If you're going on a hike here, you might end up in the actual middle of the damn actual nowhere fast. So tell someone about your whereabouts before you go fucking make them elves mad at ya they gonna kill ya boy they mad af

2. Don't just venture into the middle of the goddamn road in the middle of the fucking night. Holy shit what the fuck like what the fucking shit man?

3. For winter driving: Don‘t do any major corrections on skids. The tires just lost traction momentarily and if you jerk the wheel to get control YOU‘LL JUST WHEER OFF THE ROAD WHEN TRACTION‘S BACK DUMMY!
