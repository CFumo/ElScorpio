It starts off with a nighttime patrol in the Bronx. Actually, probably not the Bronx. Let’s say LA. More fit people there. More chances to draw some SEXY LADIES. *ED: What are you talking about?*

**Full page drawing of Lizardman getting pumped on Muscle Beach.

Yeah- let’s change the first shot from a brooding noir kinda thing to this 80s imagery of guys just lifting. WHAT? We talked about this. Why’re we going with the beach thing? They’re all lifting really heavy shit but they’re like looking at Lizardman with his shirt off. What’s with this bullshit? NO.

Cut to close up of lizard head. DGAF.

DGAF? Fuck you, Ron. You may be sick of your contract, but I’m just trying to do my job. Don’t make this difficult.

Usually, you can’t be shirtless using the squat machine there, but he’s lifting so much weight that people don’t even care. Warden Darrel is just straight up staring. Who the hell is this? It’d be like those funny Archie Comix covers where Betty and Veronica are staring at Jughead decking Moose and they’re just OBVIOUSLY gonna ride him ‘til he’s raw. Like those, “WHOA!” faces. You know? No, Ron. I don’t know...

Exactly like that. And with images of 1950’s comic book characters and sweaty half-men-halflizards dancing in his mind’s eye, Warden Darrel cums a little bit in his cutoff denim shorts. A small but growing dampness just left of the zipper. Christ...

No text on that page, obviously. Just showing Lizardman’s shredded body. You can really easily see the cross around his neck. Actually, because he’s inverted and pushing the weights upwards, the cross is hanging down near his neck. We really want to push the religious aspect of Lizardman. WHY do we need push the religious aspect of Lizardman??? Anyway, the next page is him in the surf with a short surfboard. Maybe… wait. That wouldn’t really make sense from a continuity POV, you know? Yes, Ron. I know...

Alright- yeah. Instead of that we can do… But before we table that image, we NEED to have him surfing.For Christ’s sake. WHY?

Second panel is gonna be him getting called out? Yeah! Could be like a throwback to old school cartoons in the 90s? That’ll get the millennial crowd into Lizardman. It’s like one of those closeups of lizardman straining hard to get his pump on and the text is, “HEY, FAGGOT!” NO NO NO NO NO NO.

And the next panel is Lizardman still in the same pose, but he’s PISSED. And then he just totally nails the last rep and gets up to see who the fuck called him out.

Maybe actually that would upset some people? The word, that is. No shit! Gotta think of something a little more PC? But if we give Blitzkrieg this aura of ASSHOLE, “faggot” could be appropriate. Stop. Whatever, I’ll make a note to call Samantha. She’ll do the PR edits. Edits? This trash deserves to burn.

So Lizardman gets to his feet and looks right. Then next panel he’s looking left. Next page.

FULL CENTER-FUCKING-FOLD of Blitzkrieg sitting all cool-like on the concrete divider between the workout area and the rollerblading area. He’s smoking a cigarillo and wearing polarized Ray-Banz. Jesus, Ron… Gold rings are on his hairy fingers. The thing about Blitzkrieg is that he’s waaay above the law. Is this supposed to be my husband? Fuck you, Ron. He’s so crooked, but also really rich so he pays off the fine police force of Santa Monica. He’s wearing a tank top with the words “I love BP” where the heart is oily and the British Petroleum logo is transparent behind the text. There’s a hot girl looking at him, titties barely contained by her expensive Louis Vuitton bathing suit. NO. THIS IS A DISNEY-OWNED COMIC. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU. The top of the page has the bold text “BLITZKRIEG” in loud, bloody letters. Inside the letters, there is *smaller text that spells out different really bad things like “HOLOCAUST” and “NAZI.” Also “9/11 WAS A LIE” and “I <3 ARMENIAN GENOCIDE.” Basically we want readers to know without a SHADOW of a doubt how fuckin’ evil this guy is.*

*Just so we know, of course, Blitzkrieg is gonna be pretty complicated. He’s not just evil, he’s really complex. The bad things he does he does for good intentions or something. We’ll figure out what in the future, but if there’s one thing I learned from Profitable Fiction Writing is that the Heel always has to become the Hero at some point.*

*So the reader turns the page and it’s a closeup of Blitzkrieg’s face. He has a big dimple chin and scruffy facial hair. Kinda messy hair, but he’s definitely using product in it. A real douche bag, but he looks SHARP in a messy kind of way. BK has this shit eating grin on his face.*

*Next panel is the same image, but he’s saying “‘sup.”*

*No question mark, just an asshole trying to get Lizardman to ACT.*

*Well, Lizardman DOES. He doesn’t pussyfoot around like Superman or Martian Greenman or some shit. He just fuckin’ DECKS BK. It’s basically the same panel as the other two, except it’s Lizardman’s fist in BK’s face.*

*Lizardman has anger problems.*

*Next panel is Lizardman with a look of pain because he punched without thinking- just anger. He also says “FUCK!” This is gonna be a pretty risque comic. Gonna have noir elements and be pretty edgy.*

*Next panel is BK laid out on the concrete with random people’s feet around him. It’s his POSSE. They’re gonna glower at Lizardman and as the sounds of beatings happen Blitzkrieg’s face changes from bloodied and dazed to laughing and evil. He KNEW that Lizardman couldn’t stop himself. See, if we go with the Taoist Lizardman angle, we can make him like get REALLY pissed when people are wronged because of some karma shit or something. Samantha, figure that out.*

NO.
