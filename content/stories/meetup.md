The last time I saw Myra was 372 days ago. Approximately. But who's counting? It was hard to forget because it was Valentine’s Day when she broke my heart. Though I probably broke hers too. I'd assumed she lost my number, maybe even moved out of town. Until she left a message for me a week ago urgently asking to meet with me. Well the real message sounded light hearted and chatty - “Just thought we could meet for coffee!” - but there's something about being with someone for a year and four months that just makes you know.

Through a drawn out game of phone tag, we agreed to meet here. I'd accounted for her usual tardiness and still I was sitting alone sipping my coffee and trying not to make eye contact with the couple eyeing my table.

“So sorry I'm late!” Her voice fluttered from behind me. Myra looked up at me expectantly and I stood up to give her a hug. “My god, Darren, you're a giant!”

I tried to make a joke to cover up how flustered her familiar smell made me. She left to order - a chai latte, her usual - before joining me again. Her face wasn't quite as pretty as I remembered and I felt a sense of relief. We launched into small talk that was simultaneously comfortable and strained.

After an awful joke I made - through which she humored me with a laugh - she lightly touched my hand, as if to steady herself. “I don't know if you remember-I had this ring, a ruby one, and I think I left it at your place. I wanted to get it if you still have it.”

I vaguely remembered stashing it away in the back of my desk. Or was it my dresser? “Now?” I asked, surprised.

“Well I came by your place about a month after we broke up but I saw you walking up to your door with a girl on your arm.” She smiled, wryly. “Didn't want to ruin the mood.”

“Ah.” I sat there awkwardly. “Yeah, sure, I'll look around for it.”

“Thanks.” Myra looked relieved. “If you could get it to me by noon tomorrow that would be great.”

I raised my eyebrows. “Uhh that's soon.” She looked uncomfortable. I couldn't help my curiosity. “Any particular reason?”

She paused, before looking me in the eye. “It's a matching set, with me, my mom, and Lissa. Lissa wants us to wear them when we put mom in the ground.”

I stared at her, at a loss for words. “I, uh, sorry. That sucks. I don't know what to say.”

She snorted. “Wasn't that always the problem?” Her voice was low, as if she didn't mean for me to hear it.

“Hey, if you want to talk, I'm here-”

“Nope!” She took the last gulp from her cup. “That's all. If you could leave it in your mailbox I'll come get it from you tomorrow.” Before I could say anything she gave me a quick kiss on the cheek. And then she was gone.
