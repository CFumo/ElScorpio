Caitlin is five. She is adorned in beads and rings and bangles. Tiny hands heavy with gold and silver float over the cluttered dresser, searching for the mirror. It is hard to find under the mess of knotted necklaces and bracelets. She reaches further into the shiny mound she has created, feeling for a flat, glassy surface. Her feet dangle playfully with toes wriggling in green and yellow socks. Her bushy brown hair bounces. She smiles into the mirror. Mommy hasn't come home in days.
