Sweet void, upon seeing you I weep.

Summoning screams urge me to change within you-

to fall into an endless sleep

and be reborn once more.

A cyclic life with no direction and respite

abound with sweet pain and hurtful pleasure.

Bleak times arise, which we ignite

to repeat ourselves once more.

A haze of lies leads onward to a dream of misdirection.

The tales filled, fat with noxious promises.

Transparent, thanks to those who show some indiscretion.

Accepting nothing triggers transformation

and we are slaves no more.
