The Sacrificial substance- blood. Sublimated into wishes.

O One Who Waits in the Depths, drink.

Ye of great power, drink.

Drain

â€¦

The ritual must complete. The directive is not acquired.

Trade the soul in plasma. Trade the soul in platelets.

enter the branching blood vessels through the veil

becoming the reviled- the sacrificial lamb

cross the void-dream barrier. i command

cross the threshold. no salt. no rice

dim the sun with your breath

dim the moon with my wish

Take me, your vessel.

Break Free Now.

with this willing

sacrifice

waiting

weep

as the forever-home is smashed and smeared away so are the boundaries of the sanity of man.

bleed. bleed. bleed. bleed. bleed. bleed.

I see you hiding there, the one who waits. Step forth- I am not bound by my humanity. Endlessly breathing, endlessly shambling. Find the host; willing now. Commit genocide with my hand. Cause endless suffering with my words. You are free to command this wretched puppet. As I drain away, I feel the pressing of the otherworld. I see now things that never been seen. I am an engineer of my own mind and perception. Cross the threshold. The veil is so thin. I can see you. Sheer material not hiding your visage: long hair, height as great as mountains. Attempt to speak through me. Only darkness comes via osmosis. My curses have been heard. My claws have been dug in. I have taken root and now come through the veil. Coming into this willing puppet. He has festooned his life with souls. Time to suck them all dry, closest first. A chain link of humans unsuspecting. A host of hosts, this web. He is unborn while I am here. May I cloud the sun with my breath. Dim the moon, as is his wish. But I need the blood. I needed the power of a witch and her unborn. Still, a lamb is a lamb. If the host is willing, he will rain onto others with his vile blood. I crossed the veil. I surfaced with the crimson calf. My host is the horned beast. Let the age of decrepitation commence.
