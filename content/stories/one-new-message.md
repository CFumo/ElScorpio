Hey Eddie. I'm just calling to say...I can't-I'm picking Greg. That sounds so horrible to say. I wish I could tell you in person but that wouldn't be for another 2 weeks. It's not that I don't care about you. I do. I feel like in the end I had to pick between who makes me more happy versus who makes me less sad. We've had some really nice times together but I just can't be content with complacency. I know I "understand" you, but do you *understand* me? I'm sorry. I really shouldn't do this over voicemail. Is there a way to delete this? Maybe this-
