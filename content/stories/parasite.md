In 1859 a parasite was described which will take over the mind of an ant and bring it to find the highest point in its surroundings in order to be eaten by its closest predator, fulfilling the destiny of the parasite to become the next step in its lifecycle. The fungal parasite is viral enough to lay waste to entire ant colonies, though the most common exposure factor lays around five percent of the population.

In 1908 a parasite was described which will take over the mind of a rodent and bring it to find the closest predator in order to be eaten by it, fulfilling the destiny of the parasite to become the next step in its lifecycle. The protozoan parasite is viral enough to infect nearly a quarter of all warm-blooded animals on Earth.

In 2016 a parasite was described which will take over the mind of a human and bring it to become its own predator, fulfilling the destiny of the parasite to become the next step in its lifecycle. The winning parasite is viral enough to infect about half the human population.
