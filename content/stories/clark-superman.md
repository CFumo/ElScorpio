“No, no! No!” Dr. Luthor screamed and waved his hands as the Man of Steel began tearing a 20,000 ton nuclear reactor out of its base isolator. The reactor automatically initiated its scram sequence in an attempt to prevent itself from melting down. Panicked engineers streamed away from the reactor facility, screaming about radiation and explosions.

“I will never let you use your kryptonite superweapons on the people of Metropolis, Lex!” Screamed Superman, hoisting the reactor chamber over his head. Chunks of hardened concrete and rebar rained down on the fleeing scientists.

“God damnit, Clark! I told you already! It’s a power generator! Kryptonite is not a real thing!” Dr. Luthor ran through the crowd, dodging falling rubble, trying to keep up with Superman.

“Only a foe as brilliant as you would know my secret identity,” Superman cackled maniacally.

Lex reached a group of worried looking police officers who were running in from the front gate of the facility.

“Oh, okay. Just… Stay calm guys. He’s having another episode. We just need to make sure he feels like he’s in control.”

Superman’s head cocked to one side as if he was listening intently. “Lois? LOIS!? … Lois Lane is in trouble! I have to help her!”

“Oh no…” Dr. Luthor rubbed his forehead. “Okay, someone call the national guard. We’ll need a helicopter to track-”

In an instant, Superman flung the entire reactor into the distant horizon and screamed “Hold on Lois! I will save you!”

Dr. Luthor tried to say “Damnit Clark, leave my wife alone!” but his words were interrupted by the supersonic crack of the Man of Steel flying away.
