*Tonight’s the night I'm going to fuck Dan. Or try to anyway.*

Annie stared at herself in the mirror and wiped the mascara residue from under her eyes. She rearranged her bangs before heading back into the bass-infused gathering. Dan was on his phone, lining up the playlist.

*This is where I go up to him and ask if he wants to fuck and then he scoops me up in his arms because he's so turned on by my brashness.*

Annie felt her face heat up just thinking about it. Somehow, it had seemed a lot easier in her head. Possibly because in the imagined scenario the twenty-odd people in the room evaporated before she opened her mouth.

“What’s up?” Dan was staring at her now and Annie had a hard time keeping his gaze.

“Do you wanna…” She said to his left eyebrow.

“What?” Dan shouted back at her. The low roar of the music made it hard to distinguish words.

“A drink?” Annie finished.

*After which you take me upstairs to your room and undress me?*

“Sure,” he yelled back. Dan placed his hand lightly on her back to guide Annie towards the kitchen. Annie felt her stomach somersault.

*Actually, how about we clear off this table and do it right here?*

He poured them each a shot. “To good friends.”

*To good friends...who make out and get naked together.*

They made their way back to the couch and sat down, their knees touching. Annie found herself cradling his hand in her own. She couldn't quite remember how it started. The alcohol was getting to her.

“Your pointer finger is longer than your ring finger,” she observed.

*Oh what I wish these fingers would do to me. Like trace circles on my inner thigh. And slowly get higher and higher-*

“Huh. What does that mean?” he raised an eyebrow at her.

*That you're an excellent finger-fucker.*

“Uh,” Annie was flustered. “Maybe that you're gonna be rich?”

Dan chuckled and then took her hand in turn.

*Okay, can I just straddle you right here and have you carry me upstairs? And then you’d pin me against the wall and tease my nipples over my shirt before caressing them with your tongue.*

Annie stole quick glances at his face as he examined her hand.

“Yours is the opposite,” he wiggled her ring finger. “It's longer.”

“Mmm. Hm”

*Like, seriously, I would suck your dick right now. And I don't go around doing that usually. And then right when you get close to finishing, I’d pull back and turn around and guide you inside-*

“Annie!” She looked up to see her friends beckoning for her. “Hurry, we have to get Kat home and the Uber is here.”

Dan stood up with her and she leaned in to give him a hug goodbye. As she pulled back he caught her face in his hand and kissed her. Annie grasped the back of his head to deepen the kiss. She lightly traced his parted lips with the tip of her tongue before pulling back abruptly.

“Whoa.” He looked at her with a bit of surprise.

Annie grinned at him then turned to catch up with her friends.

*Next time. Next time it’s fucking on.*
