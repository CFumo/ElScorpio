Jonathon leaned into the icy wind with all his might. Every heaving step against the buffeting gale felt to his legs like dragging a whale carcass across a beach. The town was still a pinprick in the black night. There was no other light. It was like blindness. Only the smallest beacon of hope grew infinitesimally larger with his slow belabored progress.

The temperature dropped. He stooped lower and hugged himself tighter. He was an absurd emu staggering in the storm with his broad torso tottering over thin legs. His snow gear magnified the effect as it added bulk to his upper half.

His face stung fiercely. He was certain he had never felt frostbite like this before. The intense biting sensation began at his nose and tore across his cheeks, forehead, and chin. On Christmas morning, the local headlines read, “Dead Man Found, Face Like A Bowl Full Of Jelly.”
