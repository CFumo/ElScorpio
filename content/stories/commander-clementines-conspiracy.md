07:40:30 CMDR We're fine. I'll give a full report when we've got things levelled out.

Commander Clementine Phillips was furious. It had to be sabotage. Nobody could be so stupid. Nobody! Fuck! Shit! Stupid! Piss on a cunt! Fuck! What was she going to do now? Fuck, fuck, fuck!

Phillips in her entire career had never experienced such -- she had to admit this was in typical fashion -- but argh it's the worst timing possible! The payload had just come through. The damn thing is sitting in the middle of the receiving arena just waiting to get discovered. The smallest amount of dread creeped up on her when she thought of anyone inspecting that container. She rationalized that shooting Pillows had provided enough distraction. And set an example, of course. It was all actioned to maintain strict order under exceptional circumstances, she would attest. He was not cooperating fully to her prompt investigation of the event. Her superiors would let it slide.

"Windsor?" "Sir, yes, sir!" "Drop that." "Sir, uh, yes, uh -- Sorry, Tina." "It's alright. Anyway hun, let's get this cleaned up so we can start the inspection." "I'm sorry?" "The inspection needs to be carried out somehow." "Yeah, but we gotta leave the scene untouched 'till that's over with, you know?" "Fuck! Bullshit! Donkey on a stick!" she thought to herself, frowning. "You alright?" "Yeah, uh -- just concerned, that's all." "Yeah, we're here for the long haul, huh?" "Obviously," she thought. She forced a smile. Windsor awkwardly nodded. Clementine wanted to order the inspection off entirely, but suspected that would arouse major suspicion.

A long pause followed with neither party knowing how exactly to continue until Windsor cleared his throat and said, "So, we should probably start the inspection. May I?" He motioned to move past her where she blocked his way. "Windsor, dear." "Yes," he enunciated a little aghast. "How about we retire to our quarters?" "Are you feeling ok? You should talk with John if you're feeling unwell. He should be in, it's actually hours now. I will fully understand, it is an exceptional situation." Anger was quick to take over. "Goddamn you Windsor, I'm just in love!" "With me? I seriously doubt that. You and Ricky split?" How did he know about that? What sort of reaction was this to her proclamations? Fuck. And fuck him! "Fine! Do what you want. You don't even need to do any of this!" "It's literally my job, Tina." Goddammit! "Right. Well, I'll be in my quarters. Alone."

Windsor considered whether it was an invitation or a rejection against rejection and started his inspection. He eyeballed the scene, checked off the entire check list, and was done in about half a minute, after which he began hauling the items into storage. The worrisome container, one of five completely ordinary looking containers that came through during the mission, would be the last to enter.

Meanwhile Clementine had gone straight to Enrique's to complain about the state of affairs. "This is complete shit! We're fucked, you understand? Fucked!" Enrique, hands behind head, laying in bed, seemed unfazed. He was. "Babe, you kidding? Martian vacation? It'll be great," he soothed while unbuttoning his shirt. "Some vacation," she thought while unzipping her cargo pants. "The payload came today. Once they see it we're finished. Fucked!" "You're joking, right?" "I'm not joking! Why is everyone doubting me today?"

Enrique stretched an arm around her butt and pulled her into bed. "Sweetie, do I look worried?" She reluctantly admitted he didn't. "Do you know why?" She reluctantly admitted she didn't. "I'm in charge of the boxes now." "What, that's Windsor's job." "Just repaying a favor," he said and slowly slid down the length of her body, placing kisses softly on the way down to her loins. "A favor," she thought, marvelling at Enrique's ingenuity. So much unlike everyone‘s stupidity. "These people we‘re working with are such morons." "I know." "That was the stupidest thing to have happened in the history of-" A soft moan escaped her lips as Enrique gently traced her labia with his index finger. "Did he show you the inspection schedule and how they have to be rotated at least every week?" she asked after a little while. "Uh huh," he answered, preoccupied. "Ok honey, but I don't want any fuck ups. That's all our supplies down there." He looked up. "I know," he replied. She wasn't sure whether it was a heartfelt reply or annoyed. Her deliberations melted away when he refocused his efforts on her clit.

One thought held form, though, prompting her to plainly state: "I'm going to kill the fucker who wrecked the portal." Disconcerted by how out of place that sounded, not to mention the fact that he was the one who did it, Enrique redoubled his efforts and fell out of rhythm. "What is he doing down there," she thought. "Hey." "Uh?" "Slow down, cowboy." "Uh, sorry, is this better?" It kind of wasn't. Clementine wondered what Windsor was up to.
