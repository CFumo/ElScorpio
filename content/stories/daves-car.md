At a cursory glance, Dave's car probably looked like a normal blue-grey Honda Accord cruising down Ventura Blvd. The scene *inside *the car was a little more chaotic. There were four people in the back: one was sitting on the floor, and one was splayed across the whole seat, with her head in one person's lap and her feet in another's. She was thrashing unnaturally and making a continuous whining groan, which occasionally rose to a shriek.

Dave was sweating profusely in the driver's seat. He nervously pushed his glasses up his nose as he changed lanes. Shawna was twisted in the passenger seat to look into the back. As she watched, wide-eyed, Reed shuddered and vomited a viscous mixture of black fluid, blood, and what looked like dog hair.

The other passengers flinched back. On the floor, Jennifer squeaked and scrabbled backward toward the opposite side of the car.

"Holy shit," said Shawna. "Your rug, man…"

"Fuck the rug," said Dave, "is she okay, is she breathing?"

"She's hyperventilating," said Nina, who had Reed's head in her lap. She frantically brushed hair from Reed's face, impervious to the grime and stench. "Hang on Reed, stay with us baby."

"I think I'm gonna throw up," said Gerald from the other seat. In the footwell, Jennifer was crawling back toward Reed's head, holding up her rosary and resuming her tenth Hail Mary.

"Jesus Jen that thing isn't doing anything," said Shawna.

Dave jabbed an angry finger at Gerald through the rearview mirror. "You. Do not throw up. You,"—finger at Nina—"Do not let her change it here."

"I have no control over her, David," said Nina, with forced patience. She was stroking Reed's damp hair. Reed's low moans were sounding more and more like growls. Her fingers were swelling, fingernails lengthening, sharpening.

"Holy fuck her fucking hands," said Gerald, almost conversationally. His face was ashy and sheened with sweat. Jennifer tried to press the crucifix on her rosary to Reed's forehead, but Nina batted it away impatiently.

"If she starts to change, just pull over," said Nina.

Dave gave a single hysterical laugh. "At noon on Ventura!?"

"But she's changing *now*," said Shawna.

"Oohhh, it'll get worse," said Dave. His fingers tightened on the steering wheel and the car sped up a little.

"Guys her *legs*," said Gerald, voice cracking.

"Take off her shoes," said Nina. "Jen, *please*."

Dave reached back and snatched the rosary out of Jennifer's hands. Jamming down the button on the door, he threw the rosary out the window.
