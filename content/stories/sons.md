Patrick and Anghad Singh took a taxi to visit their oldest son Bill in the hospital. Bill was recently afflicted with frequent, violent seizures, due to a genetic mutation that appeared when some of Anghad's skin cells were induced to transform into stem cells, and then into egg cells. These eggs were then fertilized by sperm cells provided by Patrick, and the mutation was passed to their son. This illness was fairly common among the biological children of same-sex couples due to unforeseen effects of the morphogenetic protein commonly used in the early days of gamete-production procedures. Bill's case was one of the first to be diagnosed, so it had received considerable media attention, which explained how opponents of assisted reproductive technology—especially when used by homosexuals— knew where to go to harass the Singh family. There was a picketer outside the hospital when they arrived, holding a sign that said "GOD HATES FAGS AND THEIR SONS." Anghad tried to distract Patrick so he wouldn't see the sign, and Patrick pretended not to see it.
