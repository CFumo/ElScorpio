We ignored all the warnings in the 1910s.

We learned nothing from the 20s.

I don't want to talk about the 30s.

The lessons of the 40s will have to be respected.

I miss the 50s.

The 60s were the pinnacle of civilization.

The 70s never happened.

The 80s never ended.

The 90s were a confusing time for all of us.

The 00s weren't that bad.

We ignored all the warnings in the 2010s.
