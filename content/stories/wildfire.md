One thing led to another, and suddenly Andrea and Stephen were hooking up on her couch. She’d tried to put this off for as long as possible, and Stephen had been patient, but in the end her desire overcame her fear.

She ran her hands through his thick black hair as he kissed a line across her collarbone. Her shirt was hiked up over her breasts, and he held a handful of the tender flesh, running his thumb absently over her nipple. God she’d wanted this. And she liked him so much, she just…

He put his warm hand on her back, pulling her close, then took her nipple into his mouth. She arched her back and whimpered with pleasure. They were going too far. She had to stop this. But instead of pushing him away she ground her hips against him, and she felt his erection thick and hot against her. He moaned at the contact. God he sounded so good. Too good…

Hold it together Andrea, she thought, hold it in, don’t fuck this up.

He slid his hand down her back and into her underwear—when had they taken her pants off?—giving her ass a brief squeeze before reaching farther, and farther, until he was running his fingers up and down the opening of her sex and she was whimpering and pressing herself against him.

“God you’re so wet,” he whispered.

Hold it in, she thought desperately, hold it in, hold it in, don’t let it out.

Stephen slipped a finger inside her and the lampshade on the end table burst into flames.

“Jesus Christ!” Stephen shouted. He fell off the couch and smacked his head on the edge of the coffee table. Andrea jumped up and, with a stricken expression, looked back and forth between Stephen and the burning lampshade several times, before leaping over the couch and sprinting for the kitchen.

Two singed dish towels and three saucepans-full of water later: Stephen was sitting on the edge of the coffee table, staring at the charred remains of the lampshade, and Andrea was huddled into the corner of the couch, staring at Stephen.

“So… you start fires with your mind,” he said.

“Yes,” said Andrea, in a small voice.

“...when you’re aroused.”

Andrea just nodded, too mortified to speak.

“Hmm…” said Stephen. He gingerly put his fingers to the bump on the back of his head. He was still staring at the ruined lampshade.

“Is it horrible?” asked Andrea.

Stephen rubbed his face with his hands. “No, it’s… kinda hot actually. You’re like a superhero.”

He finally looked at her, with a lopsided grin that made her heart give a little lurch.

“More like a villain,” she said.

Stephen laughed. “Villain, huh?”

They stared at each other for a long moment. Then he crawled onto the couch with her and kissed her tenderly.

“So,” he said, and his expression turned mischievous. “You wanna go start some fires?”
