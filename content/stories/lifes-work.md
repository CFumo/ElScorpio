This was Patrick’s masterpiece, he was sure of it. The flies were sure of it too, for only a masterpiece would distract a man from showering for so long. The bed in the studio was fully made - only because Patrick never bothered to get under the sheets the few times he allowed himself to pass out on it. The trashcan was overflowing, and a sizable stack of mail had piled at the door. “Your electricity bill is due!” one screamed. Patrick hadn't listened and had been working by lantern and candle light the past week.

He had left the house once, a week and a half ago, when the last of his favorite pens ran out of ink. Luckily, the stationary shop down the street carried them. “Jesus, Pat. I thought you were a street person,” Jack had commented upon check out. Patrick laughed distractedly before shuffling out with his purchase. He stopped by the drugstore to grab a package of string cheese and bananas. That was the last the outside world had seen of him.

Patrick had written a novel before. In fact, he was locally famous. All the bookstores in town had carried his book and he occasionally saw people on the bus reading it. He had refused to put an author’s picture in the back cover to maintain anonymity. Patrick despised fame. He was in it for the art.

Patrick could feel that the end was near. Perhaps it was the dwindling candle wax that hinted at it. His plot was tight, his characters alive. Sometimes he’d even talk to them. “Oh Amanda, you think you're so clever. How little you really know. Just you wait.” All that was left was the finale. The conclusion.

An outsider may have pinpointed that Patrick was reluctant to finish. He had poured his spirit into it. When it ended, what would that mean for him? The thought of a sequel had crossed his mind once, but he shook it away in disgust. He hated sequels for sequels sake. And so he marched on, both yearning and dreading progression.

It was just before dawn that Patrick laid down his final period. The lantern had flickered off hours before and the candle wick sat in a pool of wax. A rush of adrenaline cut through his exhaustion. “Yes! It's complete!” Patrick marveled. And then he keeled over and died.
