((My char: Christian is a half vampire/half demon. He is 6’8”, 220 pounds. Muscular. He has purple-red hair down to his elbows. His eyes are silver and one of them turns pure black when he’s angry or remembering his past. He wears a long red/black coat and carries a sword on his back and has two guns on his hips. Christian has a dark past and is haunted by the things he saw. He also has demon wings that appear when he is startled. Because of his demonic blood, he can be in sunlight))

Christian stands at the foot of a hill in Joshua Tree’s Indian Cove area, wistfully looking toward the sunrise. He is lost in thought, remembering his past.

Smorpheus is a 12000 year old Neolithic vampire. He has olive skin, is very muscular, and has large fangs. He is both the most animalistic being anyone has ever seen and is the most refined and wise. Smorpheus wears a blood-red cape.

He perches on a large rock like a silent watcher.

My character is Chad and he is of average height and is of a normal build. His hair is light brown, as are his eyes.

“Hey guys! I got separated from my hiking group. Mind if I tag along?”

DemonicSoul777

((Nice. Cool that we have more than 2 peeps. Last RP was totally empty lol)) Christian looks wistfully at Chad. “The only thing that can stop you from doing what you want is God…. or The Devil himself” I say and flip my long purple red hair in the wind.

Thrustrust

Smorpheus hisses in pleasure and disappears in a field of haze. He reappears on a different rock. His thin, muscular body gleams with a healthy sweat.

“We should probably head out. I’m carrying my friend’s sandwich and he’ll get hungry.”

Thrustrust

Smorpheus blinks out of sight and appears from behind the rock he was perched on. His grace is infinite.

DemonicSoul777

Christian turns to Chad and wistfully says, “Nice La Sportivas. What kind of climbing do you do?”

Josh1997

Chad blinks. “I don’t actually climb that much. Just rented these shoes. I don’t know a lot about the gear.”

Squiggle69_

Rocks are super cool. Squiggle69_ eats a crystal Negg. “YUM lol”.

DemonicSoul777

Christian sets off and says wistfully, “let’s go. It’s almost sunrise.”

even though it’s the sun and he is a vampire, Christian doesn’t die from it. He only feels the pain but he is used to it because in his past he went through a lot of horrors.

Josh1997

Chad follows and whistles to himself.

Josh1997

((Anyone there?))

Smorpheus rushes after Christian and Chad. A darkness follows in his footsteps, turning the grass and gravel dark. He senses something super evil.
