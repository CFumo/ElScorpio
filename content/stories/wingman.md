“Bro, I’m telling you. She was hot, bro.”

“Dude, I was there and I’m telling you, Ernie, you were drunk. And again, not by any stretch of the human imagination, was that person you were talking to, hot.”

“Whatever, man. I’m gonna call her.”

Ernesto rolled to his side and pushed himself up from the floor. He fantasized as he grabbed his cell from the kitchen counter. She was so hot. Oh man, those fucking lips… His thumbs were clumsy with anticipation as he dialed.

Steven was used to this Sunday afternoon ritual. Every other week Ernesto would ditch him at the bar, sidle up to anything in the vicinity that breathed, and use shotgun tactics to improve his odds. It rarely amounted to much, but the next day while lying in their room, Steven would hear about all the just-misses and 3rd bases anyway. He wouldn’t mind it if it weren’t so much the same every time.

Again and again, he watched the pathetic performance play out. Steven and Ernesto would stroll into the local dive on a Saturday night to keep up with the scene and check in with the other regulars. Eventually his friend would be four or five in and brimming with optimism. This week Steven sat close enough to hear snippets of the sorry excuse for dialogue.

“Hey, anyone ever tell you how your eyes look like a galaxy of stars?”

Over Ernesto’s shoulders, Steven saw the presumably female creature blush. Too easy. The always-a-wingman-never-a-bride sighed and turned to contemplate what was left of his drink rather than having to witness the rest of this overwrought mating ritual.

Prepared with a list of practiced, tested, and nearly universal compliments, Ernie continued peppering his latest target: those sun-kissed lips, that moon-beam skin, a laugh that shoots across the bar soaring like a rocket to his heart. It was all too much for the casual observer to stomach, but sometimes it really worked. Go figure.

By the end of the night, cells were scanned, numbers exchanged, and Steven had the privilege of supporting Ernesto on his journey back to the ship. As they waited for the valet to arrive, Steven shook his head and wondered whether he should tell him. He probably wouldn’t remember the next day anyways.

“Ernie, you do realize that your catch for the night in there had tentacles, right? In fact, I’m pretty sure Farssidayans have only one gender. And probably lay eggs. I’m not even sure you could, you know, find a decent hole.”

No matter how many times or how often Ernesto went off planet, he never learned his lesson.

He waved Steven off, trying to straighten up as he slurred defiantly, “Whatever, man. I’m totally gonna call her.”
