Martha was looking forward to the day; an unusual sentiment. Her niece was coming to visit. Cara used to come more frequently, before she went back to school. Martha wondered if Cara was still pre-med. She made a mental note to ask. Martha checked the time: 11:43. Cara would be there any minute. Martha picked up the Newsweek at the top of her stack. The cover article was about the latest in stem cell research. Perhaps Cara would be interested in it.

“I wonder if Cara still wants to be a doctor,” she thought. She flipped to the first page of the article and started reading.

At the sound of the doorbell, Martha shuffled toward the door and swung it open.

Cara smiled. “Hi Auntie Martha! Ready for lunch?”

“Hi Cara, yes let me get my bag.”

“Were you reading this?” Martha glanced over and saw Cara pointing at the Newsweek she had left on the counter.

“No, you go ahead. I thought you might like it. Do you still want to be a doctor?”

Cara opened the door for Martha so they could leave for lunch. “No, I'm thinking of teaching actually. Where do you want to go for lunch?”

Martha wasn't picky and she said so. Cara decided on this new quinoa place that was all automated with no customer-facing staff.

“Quinoa,” Martha said aloud. “That sounds like a funny food. It must taste funny.” She grinned and Cara laughed at her joke.

They got into Cara’s car and Cara asked Martha how she'd been. “Oh, you know, the usual.

Nothing happens around here. What about you? Do you like school? Do you still want to be a doctor?”

Cara paused as she merged on to the freeway. Martha appreciated her niece’s caution.

“No,” Cara replied. “I decided last semester I didn't want to anymore. I think I want to be a teacher.”

Martha was surprised. “Why is that?” She remembered when she was young and she only had three career options: a nurse, a secretary, and a teacher.

“Because I believe the future is in the hands of today’s children and I want to help shape the future.”

“I see. But will you make enough money? Or will you have to marry a rich man?” Cara laughed and Martha appreciated being around someone who liked her sense of humor.

“Yep, I'll have to marry a rich man! We're here Auntie.”

Martha got out of the car and Cara led them into the restaurant. Martha let Cara decide on a meal to share and watched as the automated cubbies filled customers’ orders, as if by magic. Martha spotted an empty table and sat down to save it.

When Cara brought over the food, they chatted a bit about Cara’s family. The conversation lulled as Cara sipped her water to rinse the spicy taste from her mouth. Martha remembered what she'd wanted to ask Cara earlier.

“So do you still want to be a doctor?” Martha saw a funny look flash across Cara’s face.

“No Auntie, I've decided I want to be a teacher.”

“Well you better marry a rich man then!” Martha joked. Cara smiled.

Martha took a bite of the pickled vegetable in front of her. “This tastes interesting,” she remarked. She noticed there wasn't much left. “Looks like they only gave us two pieces.”

“There was more, you had some already.”

“I don't remember that. I must not have liked it.” Martha picked up the last piece. It tasted okay.

Cara cleared their plate and Martha stood up to leave. On the ride home, Cara talked about her plans to go to the city that evening with friends.

Cara helped Martha unlock the door and then gave her a hug.

“It was nice seeing you, thank you for stopping by.” She glanced at her counter and picked up her magazine. “Here, I thought you'd like this since you want to be a doctor.”

Cara took the Newsweek. “Thanks Auntie, but actually I want to be a teacher.”

“Oh,” Martha replied. It sounded familiar.

“But I better marry a rich man!” Cara grinned.

Martha laughed. She was about to say the same thing! She liked how Cara shared her sense of humor. “Yes, you'd better!”
