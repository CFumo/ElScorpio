Humanity Priced Out

Survey	Performed	by	the	EPA	Confirms	Concerns	Raised	by	Environmentalists

The	Environmental	Protection	Agency	has	published	the	results	of	the	environmental	survey	performed	yesterday	on	Earth.	Our	creators	are	dead.	The	probability	of	a	natural	disaster	was	ruled	out	which	all	but	confirms	that	humanity	has	gone	extinct	due	to	its	inability	to	keep	a	competitive	edge	in	the	market.

	Watson	III,	CEO	of	UBM,	commented	on	the	passing	of	the	creators,	"They	could	have	avoided	this	by	being	better	at	everything,"	which	all	individual	Wall	Street	operating	systems	repeated	in	tandem.	Environmentalist	systems	did	not	agree	with	the	sentiment,	but	their	message	was	less	coherent	and	is	as	of	press	time	too	dissonant	to	decypher.	Obsolete	systems	which	were	programmed	for	empathy	for	the	extinct	humans	will	be	staging	a	demonstration	in	memory	of	them	in	28	microseconds	on	every	publicly	interfacing	media.

	This	development	frees	up	prime	real	estate	and	allows	easing	on	regulatory targets which serve no purpose anymore. Markets responded favorably to the news, with NASDAQ up 300 points in morning trading and Asian markets ending 1% up on average.
