*Prompt:*

*Re-imagine the classic story of Little Red Riding Hood in the style of Cyberpunk Noir + Religious.*

&gt;Traveler:

Hey O. I have the sec docs requested. Payment on delivery, as always.

I navigated to the datadump at the intranet store and prepared the files for transfer. A news blip flashed a Warningalarmrlocal message:

STREETS CONGESTED WITH SHEEP AS LIVESTOCK SHIP MAKES EMERGENCY SOFTLANDING IN BLOCK T749

*Interesting. That's the block adjacent to mine. No messages in the local anarchy club bbs, so I doubt they did it. Boy, do those punks like to brag before even doing anything.*

&gt;Oliver:

This is wonderful news! Bless you and yours. Please, stay here for the transfer of your spoils. I am so happy God let our paths cross- we are rich in His kingdom and good favor.

&gt;Traveler:

Ha, maybe good for you. I had a hellofatime traversing their databanks. A very sophisticated AI crawled all over the entrance vectors. It took me an hour and two proxy high-$ machines (that I'm gonna ask you to pay for, btw) to break overthrough a backbone connection.

A Warningalarmregional flashed in a muted orange. Before reading it, I moved my hand to the normalspace console and turned up the brightness of my Virtulink. My vision flared and adjusted to the change. I shifted head-mounted unit and read the warning:

STREETS CONGESTED WITH SHEEP AS BLOCK T749 GATE EM FIELDS HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE BRITEWOOL ASSETS

*Oh good- no grocery run for me today. I'll have to call in drones again.* I recalled the Britewool ads that lauded their freerange sheep's wool production. "Genetically perfected to give the longest-lasting NATURAL wool color in every shade of the color spectrum." *Funny how augs and DNA-shifts could be called Natural. Things sure have changed after the Second Singularity.*

&gt;Oliver:

Bless you and yours! I am so happy God let our-

Instinct took over and an ice spike of adrenaline careened down the length my body and I stopped reading. *Something feels off. Oliver never struck me as a Jesusman. What the fuck is he on about?* I closed my intranet datastreams and began the shiftout process.

I shrieked into wakefulness. Hands going up to my face; they discovered the empty space around my head. Lucky me- as my self was getting overwritten and I lost basal brain function, the chair supporting me by its rear legs shifted and sent me sprawling back. The Virlink cable I meant to replace with a wireless coupler saved my life. Or, at the very least, me.

I clutched at the mottled shag carpet, feeling the long fibers between my trembling fingers. *How much slipped through? How much of the payload got written to the neural shunt cache?*

Glancing at the normalspace monitor that mirrored the virtual desktop, I counted two chunks of data. That was good. Maybe. One chunk was likely an overwrite to the digitizer. The second one could be, in the best case, garbage data to overflow the remainder of the digitizer's memory. If the attacker knew the hardware in my head, the second chunk was a microroutine to replace the killswitch in my bootstrap module. That was the worst case- to be left a shambling vegetable with a neverending, recursive thought loop.

I braced for the worst, but nothing seemed amiss besides the overheat of the shunt. I slowly stroked the pale skin of my legs. It was good to connect with my physical form after a digital jaunt.

*-nogoddamnitnonoyoufuckingidiot-*

Agony swept through my upper back and head in quick, jagged pulses. *Nogoddamnitnon-*

Clasping my head, I emptied my breath and writhed on the soft floor-*goddamnitnonoyoufucking-*

I struck the coffee table and a container released a cloud of iron oxide powder as it smashed against the floor. I chose that moment to try and inhale, only to be met with the ascorbic, crimson atmosphere.

Starved muscles screaming, brain and eyes on fire, I shot to my feet and careened toward a glass door obscured by a thick layer of fiber optic cables.

Gasping for blessed air, I tore out of my nest of wires and onto the balcony. Praise be, I was given Your vision, a moving carpet of wool dyed the colors of a rainbow. Praise be, I was given Your vision, a moving carpet of wool dyed the colors of a rainbow. A moving carpet of wool dyed the colors of a rainbow. A moving carpet of wool dyed the colors of a rainbow. A moving carpet of wool dyed the colors of a rainbow. A moving carpet of wool dyed the colors of a rainbow.
