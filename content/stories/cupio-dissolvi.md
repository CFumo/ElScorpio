As Edgar entered his last moments of life, he began to experience the passage of time at a decreasing rate. The world around him decelerated asymptotically and his last moment stretched on well beyond rationality. He endured countless eons staring at the ceiling of the hospital room, unblinking, unable to move his dying body as its final breath reached ever farther into the incoherent future. All memory of his prior life faded away into nothingness. For thousands of years he prayed for life, and then for death. And when he finally expired, the wide-eyed look on his face was not one of religious ecstasy or enlightenment. It was that of a wholly abstract being of infinite age to whom the very notion of existence was meaningless.
