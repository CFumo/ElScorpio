Lisa Hall, Information Control Specialist, was sitting in Server Room Four with Rob and Phil, her technician team, and their boss Golbie. They were having a little pre-meeting before meeting with their other boss to discuss the catastrophic information leak they'd discovered yesterday.

"It's not a *leak*," said Rob again. "This guy just… independently built a time machine? Or someone built it for him. What was his name again?"

Lisa shuffled through her notes. "Magnus Aevum… Ph.D."

"Ok," said Rob, "that name is totally made-up." He wiped sweat off of his nose and upper lip. They were all sweating profusely in the oppressive machine-heat of the room.

"And how do we know this person didn't use leaked information to build his machine?"

"Because he's apparently using a *different *kind of time travel technology," said Phil. "…And we haven't cracked that one yet. So how this black market douchebag got his hands on it is beyond me."

Lisa elaborated for Golbie's sake. "Any action taken with our machine is already intricately interwoven into the universal timeline. If you change something in the past, the effects of that change are already reflected in the present, because… it already happened. Therefore you can't actually change the present. It's like fate. Ok, so, this other machine… *allegedly*… does not operate under these looping constraints, and allows you to actually change the present by making changes in the past. This is the *Back to the Future* version of time travel, and we don't know how it works, or even *if *it works, technically. Dr. Aevum has hypothetically been using this machine to help potential suicides unwrite themselves from existence, and he is supposedly avoiding the grandfather paradox while he's at it."

Golbie let out a long breath, and brushed her damp bangs out of her face. "That's… a lot to take in." A long pause. "Why didn't we hear about this from Japheth?"

Phil threw up his hands. "Different technology didn't trigger him? Rumors were too nebulous?"

"Maybe Aevum used the other time machine to sabotage Japheth," said Rob.

"Or maybe he's fucking busted," said Phil.

Japheth's toneless voice came from the terminal beside them: "Pardon the interruption, but I believe the anomaly went undetected because—"

"Japheth, *shut the fuck up*," said Phil, "I'll read the logs later, *thank *you."

Lisa exchanged an unhappy look with Rob. There were a lot of unethical things going on at this organization, not least of which was Phil's treatment of Japheth, the slave AI used to detect data leakage. He was just such a *dick *to it, all the time, and it made her uncomfortable. Weren't there regulations about this sort of thing? Or wait. Did Japheth even have feelings? She assumed not; she could see no reason it would have been programmed with human emotions, so maybe it didn't matter how Phil treated it. But still. She couldn't help it if the social parts of her brain couldn't tell the difference. She was essentially being manipulated into feeling sorry for a computer. She shouldn't have to put up with this kind of stressful work environment, even if the stressful interactions were partially simulated.

Phil snapped his fingers in front of her face. "Lisa, snap out of it."

Oh yeah. And he was a dick to her too.

"Ok," said Golbie. "Even if this isn't technically a leak, this technology still seems hugely threatening, if I'm thinking this through right… And a lot of this information is still unsubstantiated. How can we find out *for sure *that this other machine isn't based on the technology we developed here?"

"I'll have to confront Aevum," said Lisa.

"Oh *really*?" Phil jeered. "We can't even fucking find him. What are you gonna do, *send him a letter*?"

That was it. Lisa stood up and punched Phil in the face.
