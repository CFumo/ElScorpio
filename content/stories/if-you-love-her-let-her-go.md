It was my fault that my wife left. I have anxiety - you know, I get very nervous. I was always worried that she would leave and that created a lot of tension, you know. I mean, I would pick and pick and worry and she would get frustrated and we would fight so I don’t blame her for leaving. In a way I always expected that she would get tired of me.

When she left, she left our daughter Sara with me. I think she knew that if she took Sara, I wouldn’t have done so well. (And she would have been right, you know.) Well, I love Sara, probably more than I could have ever loved my wife, and I worried about her even more than I ever worried about my wife. Still, she was a darling. She never got frustrated with me. She was serenity incarnate. I don’t know if I believe in god, but I know she was a miracle.

One day, I was working in the living room and I realized I hadn’t seen Sara in a little bit. I got up to check on her, but I didn’t find her at first and my mind started wandering. What could she be up to? I started looking for her all over the house. First, her bedroom. Then, the bathroom. Maybe, my room? My heart started racing and my walk turned into a jog and then into a mad dash around the house.

I found her in the kitchen. The contents of the cabinet under the sink were splayed across the floor and I knew that something bad was happening. I just knew.

She looked up at me with a big smile and told me that she was helping clean up while I was working. None of the bottles were opened. She’s safe. My god, she’s safe!

Panic drained out of me even as my body still shook. I picked her up, hugged her tightly, and started sobbing. I was so scared, so filled with emotion. Love and fear. I held onto the only person keeping me sane with all the strength I could muster and wept.

…

I’m not sure how long it took me to calm down, but after I came to my senses, I noticed Sara wasn’t smiling any more. Or moving. She just hung limply in my arms. Her face was an asphyxiated blue and her back bruised where I held her just moments ago. At that moment, when I was at my absolute lowest, I learned the lesson that I should have learned so many years ago: if you love someone, let them go.
