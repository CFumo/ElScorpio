Amanda: What if they're not even on Earth? That's why the resources are so limited.

Cameron: Like they're on Mars or something? Interesting.

Amanda: Wait, but that doesn't explain why they have to die when they're 30.

Cameron: True.

Amanda: Maybe on their space colony you age much faster so at 30 your body is more like 60 and they don't have the medical technology to support diseases.

Cameron: So they kill you.

Amanda: To prevent the spread of infection.

Cameron: Okay. I like it. What does that give us?

Amanda: Peace of mind? I don't know, I like knowing all the background info.

Cameron: So you can do your part now?

Amanda: Yeah. A love scene. For the erotica-themed issue.

Cameron: Hah!

Amanda: A threesome. With Anya, Graham, and robot-Graham. Just for Rachel.

Cameron: Uhh…

Amanda: Don’t worry! It's a dream sequence. It won't mess up the story.

Cameron: Right…
