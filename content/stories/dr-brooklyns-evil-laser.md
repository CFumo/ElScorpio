"Honey, how will we ever get the Mexicans or Ecuadorians or whatever to bring the drugs and disorder through that giant wall?" "We'll think of things. Damn that President and his ingenious inventions!" "Oh honey, kiss-" "We interrupt this program to bring you breaking news."

A distraught and a little confused news anchor appeared on screen. "Okay, we have these images of the Moon. So, I guess they are real. I.. The face of the moon has been defaced with one of these..." "Memes," could be heard off-screen. "I don't understand. Johnny did Mel put you up to this?" A simple "No," came from off-screen.

A picture of the Moon appeared, defaced with an image of Dick Butt, an Internet sensation from the late 00s. "These are supposedly, I mean, I.. is the Moon visible from here? Listen, we're going to bring our cameras and take a look..." Another picture of the defaced Moon faded in on-screen. "This one was just submitted... from..." [...] "From the area." [...] "This is ridiculous." [...] "Is there.. a, claim, to, responsibility?" the anchor asked flustered.

"So you're telling me that Brooklyn freak used a giant laser to carve that freakish cartoon on it?" the President asked an intelligence officer.

Dr. Brooklyn Maintains Innocence

The Moon defaced this morning has many questioning the purpose of Dr. Brooklyn's Giant Laser project and its intended purpose. In response the Institute of Reasearch and Such has published a short memorandum: "The Giant Laser at the Institute of Research and Such is only intended to be used for peaceful purposes. The IRS would never use a giant laser to carve a giant 'dickbutt' graphic into the Moon just to deface it. Of course we deny all involvement in this and condemn this act."
