INT. STRIP CLUB - DAY

NAKED LADIES gyrate. Their bosoms bounce like great jiggly melons. An ANGRY OLD MAN enters the club.

RIP VAN WINKLE wears olden time clothing and a sleeping cap. His long white beard reaches to the floor. He brandishes a large blunderbuss.

RIP VAN WINKLE: What kind of filthy sinful world have I awakened to?

RIP VAN WINKLE opens fire. BOOM! BOOM! A stripper flies off of her stripper pole, trailing blood, and lands in the lap of a patron whose head has become a gushing stump.

SCREAMING CROWD NOISES, CHAOS.

A SECURITY GUARD manages to hit the alarm under a table before having his neck blown open by a blast from the blunderbuss.

The shooting continues. Strippers, patrons, and bodyguards limply crawl away on the ground; most of them missing limbs or otherwise bleeding profusely. BLOOD splatters across the walls and drips down the stripper poles.

In a brief moment of reprieve, RIP VAN WINKLE takes a swig of his magical elixir. His weary eyes droop ever so slightly, and then widen again with anger. He keeps shooting.

EXT. STRIP CLUB - LATE DAY, OVERCAST

An army of POLICE CARS, MOTORCYCLES, and two SWAT VANS skid into the parking lot, sirens blazing. Heavily armored police officers pour out of the vehicles and take cover, aiming their arsenal at the front of the strip club, which is now eerily silent. A gruff POLICE CHIEF with a thick mustache and dark aviator sunglasses steps out of one of the cars and raises a megaphone.

POLICE CHIEF: This is the police, motherfucker! We have you surrounded! Come out with your hands up or we will burn this whole club down around you!

Silence. The police officers look nervously at one another and adjust their rifles. After a few seconds, RIP VAN WINKLE walks slowly out of the strip club and faces the police. He is wearing a heavy robe.

RIP VAN WINKLE: My apologies gentlemen. It seems there has been some sort of misunderstanding...

The POLICE CHIEF lowers his glasses to get a better look at the ancient man before him. A loud crack of THUNDER roils the air, suggesting a coming rainstorm. VAN WINKLE looks up at the clouds as drops of rain begin hitting the oily asphalt around him.

RIP VAN WINKLE (CONT’D): You see, unless you’re 300 years old and you’ve pledged fealty to King George III you are a godless American sinner. And you are my enemy.

In slow motion, RIP VAN WINKLE throws back his robes revealing two MAC-10 machine pistols. He UNLEASHES both guns at the crowd of police officers who begin firing back with everything they’ve got.

POLICE CHIEF: Waste that bastard!

BULLETS ping off of every surface. The police cars’ windshields are SHATTERED and the front of the strip club is SHREDDED by the sheer volume of gunfire. RIP VAN WINKLE’S long white beard becomes a dark red as the gunshot wounds he sustains begin to bleed. Police officers FALL one by one from their positions, unable to stay covered in RIP VAN WINKLE’S onslaught.

A bullet hits RIP VAN WINKLE in the eye, turning half of his face into a bleeding pile of meat. He staggers and drops to one knee.

RIP VAN WINKLE: Hahaha!

The old man smiles and throws his guns at the police officers. He reaches into his pocket and once again brandishes his elixir. He uncorks the bottle and uses one hand to pour it into his mouth, while using his other hand to flip the bird at the police officers. Bullets continue hitting his chest and making clouds of RED MIST.

POLICE CHIEF: Shoot the bottle! Don’t let him drink it!

A fizzing ELECTRICAL NOISE begins to drown out the gunfire. The POLICE CHIEF notices his arm hair standing up.

POLICE CHIEF (CONT’D): Get down!

The POLICE CHIEF ducks behind his police car and covers his face. A huge bolt of LIGHTNING hits RIP VAN WINKLE and sends a shockwave through the line of police officers. Those who haven’t ducked for cover are INCINERATED. The strip club lights on fire and the sound of THUNDER echoes through the Catskill Mountains in the distance.

The POLICE CHIEF opens his eyes and stands up to look around. RIP VAN WINKLE is gone, replaced by a smoking black CRATER in the center of the parking lot.

FADE OUT

FADE IN

INT. HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

The POLICE CHIEF walks into his house and closes the front door. His wife SARA (24f) rushes to him.

SARA: Oh my god honey! I saw the news! Are you alright?

POLICE CHIEF: Yeah, yeah, I’m fine. We lost a lotta good men though. A lotta good men.

He brushes past her and walks into the bedroom. Reaching under the bed he pulls out a rusty old box and places it on his bed. He opens the box and places his GUN and his BADGE into it such that the AUDIENCE cannot see inside the box.

SLOWLY PAN UP TO FRAME THE BOX.

Inside the box, under the POLICE CHIEF’s badge and gun, lies a dirty old REVOLUTIONARY WAR UNIFORM.

FADE OUT
