After Rosanne was impregnated by Satan, she started to crave a lot of weird food, like pickles and ice cream, anchovy mashed potatoes, iron filings, and the freshly turned earth of the grave. But none of those cravings could compare to her longing for the baby's father. God only knew why she'd thought he'd be any different, but apparently even the Devil wasn't above such banalities as bouncing once the bitch was pregnant.

She sent him a lot of angry notes demanding to know when she could expect his first child support paymentâ€”to do this she had to burn the note over a candle consecrated with goat's urine and human blood. Finally he showed up at her apartment, full of demonic fury and begging her to quit it with the notes. He explained that once the thing was born it would be removed from her care to begin its training as the antichrist, so she didn't have to worry. This made Roseanne even more upset, as she was already growing pretty attached to the germinating demon spawn. They got into one of their old arguments, which involved a lot of bleating and flashes of hellfire and fucking terrified the neighbors.

Come hell or high water she was determined to get him back. At midnight she drove to the house where he was possessing a little girl. She serenaded them through the open window, guitar resting awkwardly against her conspicuous baby bump, until someone called the cops. She also wrote him several poems, which she sent in the usual way. These were actually quite good, but went ignored. She tried to send him a mixed tape too, once, but only ended up singeing a lot of plastic.

Roseanne grew lethargic and depressed. Worried about the health of the baby, Satan sent a host of his archagents to nurse and cheer her. "C'mon Rose, you know how he is," said Astaroth, prince of accusers and inquisitors. "Besides, 'Queen of Hell'? That's a big responsibility."

But Roseanne just decided to take more drastic measures. One night she slipped past her chaperones, drove downtown, and lit an empty church on fire. That oughta get his attention, she thought. But then she wondered what the hell she was doing. She was playing right into his hand, doing his work. All this heartache, and for what? She got mad, and for good measure she drove to the nearest Satanist temple and lit that on fire too. She was kind of starting to have fun. She set fire to a Buddhist temple, and then a mosque, and felt the baby kicking with excitement. "That's right junior, we're gonna wreck this town!" She was arrested soon after.

She went into labor in the jail cell. Attended by hellish midwives, she delivered a healthy screaming baby, which she clutched tightly to her breast. But when Satan appeared, he surprised Roseanne by holding and kissing her tenderly. "I thought I would die laughing, watching all those churches burn," he said. "I didn't know you had it in you to be so wicked. Will you marry me?" Roseanne consented, and together they descended into the fiery depths of the Pit, where they reigned merrily until the Day of Judgment.
