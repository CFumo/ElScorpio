Commercial scale fusion reactions are more stable when fueled by simple hydrocarbon chains. Hydrogen fuses into helium while carbon acts as a thermal conductor and rotational stabilizer. Small amounts of additives in the fuel can reduce plasmic peaking effects, but these will become eliminated with better engine designs coming within the next twenty years. The products are then discarded by exhaust. In short, high octane gasoline powers our ships.

The discovery of gasoline powered fusion was hindered by the simple fact that nobody ever wanted that. The rare physicists who considered the possibility were not able to secure any popularity to gain even one hypothetical funding consideration. Not even oil companies considered it beneficial. the price of gasoline is now barely even considered during the construction and operation of the engines.

Only when AI-assisted research proved that gasoline was the most likely fuel candidate for sustained stable small-scale fusion did it become a small consideration. Everyone on the planet resisted. Crude oil is a limited resource. Fusion will drive gas prices sky high, how are people going to drive with fusion using up all the fuel? Gasoline can't be the future of fusion, it's a contradiction in terms. How can petrol be the future of global energy abundance?

And that's kinda all, I guess? They made them and it worked fine. They use like tiny amounts anyway, so it's not like a big deal. And you can go so fast, my ride can go from 0 to .9c in like a day. It's kind of old though, I've been thinking about getting a new one. You see the one Chrysler showed this week? Uh, sorry. Anyway, yeah, it can make it to Jupiter in like 2 hours. Want it so bad. I'm probably going to get it in red this time. Probably just a Toyota though. But yeah, blue is just not my color I found out. Like, nothing matches, really. But red goes with pretty much everything. So, yeah. Anyway, how's the Honda?
