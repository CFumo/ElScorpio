Tracey was just finishing up her bubble bath when she heard the rustling and clanging outside her window. She quickly toweled off and slipped on a bathrobe. She peered behind the bathroom curtains and saw the top of Sawyer’s disheveled head as he reached for a handful of leaves to clear out her gutters. A shiver shot down Tracey’s spine as she watched his bicep stretch the cotton of his shirt thin. Tracey had forgotten that Sawyer might come by today and she had probably missed his courtesy text.

She perched beside the window, admiring as sweat beads appeared across his brow. Sawyer was much too young for her. Technically, he was her neighbor's son. Tracey hadn't been in the neighborhood long enough to know him when he was young. He'd been boyish cute but now-

Now he was stripping off his damp shirt. Tracey inhaled audibly. His muscles bulged as he moved the ladder to get at the next section of her gutter. Without thinking, Tracey reached beneath her robe and let her fingertips glance across her breasts. She admired the grooves in his back and let her hand sink lower until it was between her thighs. His hands gripped the piles of leaves and she imagined them gripping her hips. Slowly, she rubbed herself, to the tempo of his movements. Tracey could feel the moan beginning to build as she glanced at his taut chest through hooded lids. The anticipation was building until she cried out, unable to suppress her desire.

Tracey saw Sawyer’s head jerk up and she quickly retreated from the window. Oh my god, what was I thinking? Her face burned hot as she wondered what he had heard. From across the room, her cell phone buzzed.

Sawyer: Everything okay in there? Thought I heard something. Me: All good here. Must have been my cat. Sawyer: Cool just checking.

Tracey relaxed. She didn't have a cat but he wouldn't know it. She slipped quickly into her clothes, reassuring herself that he'd noticed nothing. Her phone buzzed again.

Sawyer: Can I come play with your cat? She sounded like she was having fun…

Tracey stared at her phone with a mix of embarrassment and horror. And a pinch of desire. Was it her imagination or was he very blatantly suggesting he wanted to get it on. Before she could respond, her doorbell rang. She bolted towards the door and swung it open. There he stood, still shirtless, a smirk flicking across his lips. He stepped into the hallway and cupped her chin in his palms.

“Can I…?”

Tracey nodded her head slightly, breathing heavily. Sawyer pulled her into his body before kissing her deeply. He pulled his head back and chuckled. “You're not very good at hiding, you know.”

Before she could respond, he scooped her in his arms and carried her to her bedroom. Time to play with her cat, indeed.
