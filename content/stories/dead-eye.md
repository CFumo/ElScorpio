You need a dead eye to see into the underworld. But you can’t just be blind from birth. Nah, that doesn’t cut it. It needs to be killed and sent to hell.

I lost mine working as a line repairman for a big cable company in Atlanta. I was up in a cherry-picker trying to dislodge a big 50kV power line from this oak tree that had fallen in a storm, right, and then *bam!* The line snapped and touched my face and there happened to be a hole in my glove where my skin touched the metal of the cherry picker.

Damn it was hot.

It went right through my face and down my left arm. The skin on my arm split open like a loaf of bread in the oven. My eye just fucking blew up and dripped all over my shirt. I would have screamed from the pain but I was unconscious at that point… which was probably good.

Anyway, when I woke up I knew something was wrong right away. I could see things… things that nobody else was seeing. I tried telling folks at first but everyone assumed I had brain damage from the accident. Hell I don’t blame them, maybe my head *is* scrambled.

But honestly I don’t think my brain could invent some of the shit I’ve seen. See, you don’t really go anywhere when you die. Not really. There’s no Heaven or Hell or Angels or Demons or whatever. Or maybe it’s all Hell, I don’t know.

But I’ve tested it with all sorts of people. Good, bad, young, old, fucking evil, completely innocent… it don’t matter who you are. They all just cross over to this other place, the place I see with my dead eye, when I take the patch off.

I never did like those fake glass eyeballs by the way. They look so god darned creepy. I’d rather just look like a pirate and be done with it. Also I can only see into the other world with my damn eye-hole exposed for all the world to see. It freaks people out so I don’t do it much. Truth be told it freaks me out to see that place.

What was I saying before? Oh right. People just cross over and wake up again after they died. They just keep going like they woke up from a nap or something, except nobody can see them other than me and the other dead people. They also just keep lookin’ like they did the moment they died which, I gotta tell you, isn’t usually very pretty. Most of those folks have blood on ‘em or cataracts or bullet holes. All sorts of ghoulish stuff.

The place is terrible though, that’s for sure. I wouldn’t be lying if I said I’m still alive after all these years because I’m terrified of going there. They just pile up forever, you see. Every person who dies goes there, and they never leave. Lots of them leave the city, mind you, because otherwise it’d just be a huge pile of ‘em writhing around and screaming and such. The ones who leave seem to just wander forever.

They can see us too, and that’s the really nasty part. They can go wherever and just watch us going about our lives. Eating, sleeping, fucking, whatever. They just watch because that’s all they can do. I know what you’re thinkin’, and no. I’ve never seen them do anything dirty. Maybe because they can’t or maybe they’re just too damn sad and crazy. Most of them go crazy after a while, but they can’t really hurt each other for some reason. It’s just unsettling as hell to take my patch off and find a big group of them in my bedroom watchin’ me go to sleep or in my bathroom looking at my mirror. They’re just a bunch of psychotic corpses wandering around.

You can kinda tell how old they are from their clothes. And believe me, there are some old ones out there. They’re usually too crazy to do much other than sit and stare. Oh I didn’t mention before but they don’t seem to need food or anything. They just keep going forever, eternally getting crazier and more crowded.

I did meet a woman once who believed me. She claimed she was an exorcist. She told me she’d been there herself, and said something about needing fire to cross over. Her skin looked all scarred up, but I didn’t get a chance to ask if it was related or if she was just born like that or something.

And that’s about it. That’s what the other side is like, believe it or not. So if you do believe me, try not to die any time soon. It’s no fun at all.
