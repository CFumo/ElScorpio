In the near future, after waiting half an hour by the conveyor belt for his luggage to arrive, a tired man shuffled up to the service desk.

"Good morning and welcome to York," a young agent greeted him. "How may I be of service to you today in our wonderful new York?" he asked just as he was trained to. Marketing loved the idea of calling the new settlement "new York", although it was already causing confusion in official communication.

"Yeah, morning. Say, you wouldn't happen to know how long until the guys send the luggage through?"

"It should already be here, sir. What hub are you coming in from?"

"Toronto, arrived 1 o'clock exactly."

"It should have arrived already then. And you did not see your luggage?"

"I did not. I am certain I would have seen it."

Eyeing the now empty conveyor belt, the young agent confirmed the man's theory. "I see. Well, let me check on the status of your luggage. May I have your ID please?"

The man handed his ID over to the agent who paused on reading the name. "Mr. President!"

The president smiled. "Well, one can dream. It's not quite so significant."

"Not so significant? Only the founder and president of Intergalaxa! You're the very reason I pursued a career at your company," the young agent beamed.

"Well alright, I suppose that holds a significance," the President said a little unsure. He mostly had the honor of securing funding and had no part in Intergalaxa's breakthrough. Anyone who knew anything about Intergalaxa knew he was the least significant of the founders. "Was it my speeches?" he wondered.

The young agent tapped the screen of his terminal. He frowned in horror for a microsecond before composing himself. "I'll be just a moment."

The young agent was gone for a quarter of an hour before he came back to the desk, his head a little drained of blood and his whole body visibly shaking and tense.

"So, your luggage may have been transferred to our hub in Wisconsin," the young agent said in a low nervous voice. Usually a simple mishap wouldn't be a concern, but this one could end badly. Mostly for him, he suspected. "Wisconsin? US?" the President of Intergalaxa asked, remaining calm as he imagined the mistake would be simple to fix.

"No sir, here." the young agent explained, hoping the President would understand the scope of the problem without having to spell it out.

"And what's the problem?" the President asked. "Go get it," he commanded. Explaining the problem in clear terms would prove unavoidable: "Sir, that hub is not online yet. There is nobody to retrieve it. It will be months before it's safe for drones to even go there and set up the shields."

His memory jolted, the President took on a shade of purple.

"Well if it's not online how in the goddamn hell did the luggage end up in the middle of fucking nowhere?"

"We're looking into it right now, sir."

"Unbelievable. And it just proves I'm right, doesn't it?"

"How's that, sir?"

"Think about it. I had to check in at 8 this morning. I spent over 5 hours at the terminal, two of them just in line to the check-in. I had 20 different security guards, police and customs officers check my identity and ticket before departure. And I'm on the fast track. I run the company—sort of!— responsible for this goddamn route! Yet, I had to fill out five forms just to testify I am who I am and that there's nothing wrong with me or my stuff. And of course, there's the additional 2 hour wait while the doctors asses each one's fitness for departure. But that's besides the point. You, well, the company requires me to jump through all these fucking hoops—and I'm not even allowed one single carry-thru—and then you fuckers go around and teleport all my luggage to fucking Wisconsin? Unbelievable."
