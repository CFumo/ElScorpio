		<div id='text'><p><p>Jackson finished tying the knot; he pulled it tight to test its strength. Then, gripping the cloth, he stuck his foot through the gaping hole and began rappelling halfway down to the sands below.
</p>
<p>“Hey, come check out what I’ve done with this.”
</p>
<p>Ammon begrudgingly propped open his sarcophagus and shuffled down the pyramid halls until he reached his usual perch in the sand. The sun was setting. Its warm orange glow drenched the dunes, but the chill of the night sent a shiver down Ammon's spine. He wrapped himself tighter in the mummified garb he'd worn for centuries. He glanced up at the Sphinx where he'd heard Jackson's voice, like he had so many times since the archaeologist stumbled across his tomb. And his secret. But something struck Ammon as very odd when he looked up at the Sphinx's face this particular night.
</p>
<p>Dangling out of the Sphinx's nose, twisting and fluttering in the breeze, was a trail of yellow, hardened mummy wrapping - with Jackson at the end of it, beaming with pride.
</p>
<p>“I told you a thousand thousand times what I was gonna do if I ever caught you doing that!”
</p>
<p>Jackson stuck his head through the hole and shouted, “It’s not my fault! I swear it was like that when I got in here.” He pointed to the nostril that apparently materialized overnight.
</p>
<p>“Don’t play coy with me. I remember exactly how I left it.” "It" was the apparatus placed in the Sphinx's nose removed to clear out his sinuses on the rare occasions when the rains came. The gypsy gave one stipulation for his eternal life: Ammon was to guard the Sphinx, olfactory system and all.
</p>
<p>Ammon glared at Jackson from the hollows in his skull where his sapphire eyes once rested. He reached into the recesses of his multitude of mummified layers and slipped out his trusty bow.
</p>
<p>“Whoa. Calm down. Is it really that big of a deal?”
</p>
<p>“I’m going to count to three. If you don’t fix what needs fixing by then, I’ll be mopping your brains off of the ground.” He notched a rusted arrow.
</p>
<p>“Why does it need to come to this? I thought you got over it a long time ago.”
</p>
<p>Jackson began to shimmy his way back up the makeshift rope. He began to swing, back and forth like a pendulum.
</p>
<p>“I gave my word, that’s why. Because unlike yours, mine is worth something. Three. Two-”
</p>
<p>“Look, I put the boxes there and right under here-” “Shit.”
</p>
<p>Jackson lost his grip. The cloth got caught around his shoulder and elbow. All time stopped. The sand shifted beneath Ammon's feet and he perceived sinking, drowning in an hourglass, powerless to stop the scene playing out before him in slow motion.
</p>
<p>A sickening THUD! A cloud of dust.
</p>
<p>“You’re dead to me, Jackson. Hear that? Dead to me.”
