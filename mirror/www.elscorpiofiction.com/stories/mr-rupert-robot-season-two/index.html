		<div id='text'><p><p>Roberto Robot hangs out in the shadows of the biggest drug dealer in America in the cold steppes of Ohio. Drug dealer is giant and Robot’s sister Emily is sad and sitting in a stolen home of the Proletariat. “This is a financial system that is evil,” he says to Emilia. She agrees and squats, her mandibles dripping foul ichor. A sweet smell of benzine reminds Roberto of the time he hacked the Moon. Spaceboy Moon and Ultimate Moon, the legendary brothers that live in the seedy underworld of Tokyo, are not pleased. Roberto and his father and his sister all make it back aboard the pirate ship before it leaves Richport. They examine the fine cedar that makes up the old ship’s banisters. Pure sex. A greased leprechaun of a man slides around the poop deck, living up to the unfortunate name in a very real way. Months are spent on this ship. Roberto makes friends the same way he has always made friends- by hacking. The keratin finger covers make a distinct taptap-tapping noise as they strike the hacked together hacking keyboard. Roberto finds the money program and pwns it. All the cryptocurrency is currently hacked and no one can make purchases. The world is saved. Hack the world. Oh bother. Emilia finds a man at sea and starts a family. Leprechaun has not stopped his gyroscopic procession in the time the boat makes it to the opposing shore. They are now in Sri Lanka. The Golden Triangle! Evocative imagery makes Roberto uncomfortable and he espies a particularly large fish hung out to dry on the docks of this fine land. He makes his move. “Come here often? If you were a rootkit, I’d install you willingly. Are you a rootkit? No wonder I’d install you. You look cute. Let’s bang ;) some code out. If you were a rootkit, I’d install you willingly.” The fish is nonplussed in the uninterested sense. Roberto blames himself and society for making women not like him. “Eff Societies,” he murmurs. At this, the fish turns into a hot babe with willing flesh. She wants to see his hacks only if they are really good. He does them really good and she inverts herself. Emilia is jealous but DTF, according to her blog. In reality, she’s disinterested. Her child is growing. During the third trimester, Emilia feeds herself a particularly large maggot and falls into a torpor. While she regenerates and grows into a colossus, Roberto hacks more. This hack is particularly cool. The screen zooms in on his phone while he types using a bluetooth keyboard. He writes shell script and the phone is all black and white because he is a really cool hacker. No colors because he doesn’t even see color anymore. Really progressive. He types at 250 words per minute and then presses the Enter key. The portal is activated. TCP packets manifest as tiny flying creatures. They howl and careen into the darkness of the portal. The ones coming back have been changed by the transdimensional travel. Their own mother would hiss at them. Instantly greyed, they have lost their souls in the transfer. And yet, Roberto keeps them employed. They are his TCP packets. They may be soulless, but he has a special place in his heart for them. Once the portal seals and the woman liquefies back into a fish, the TCP packets are sleeping soundly in the cavern of Roberto’s phone. They have earned their rest. Now Mister Roper Robort takes the coax cable and plugs it into a coupler to an ethernet jack (5e). The hacking can begin. This hack is sent to the United States of America where Edward Snowden is residing in his corporate fatcat Rolls-Royce and he is on the helicopter pad waiting to be picked up by a massive helicopter. This is all part of the plan of the eleven powers that be to control the populace even more than they do right now. The hack sneaks its bad self into the control panel of the helicopter. The funniest joke is displayed on the screen that makes the 12 pilots laugh for a really long time. Just like Joker’s poison gas in that one cartoon. The pilots land the helicopter despite years of training and tell Snowden the joke. It’s absolutely foul and he doesn’t laugh very hard. The pilots are Norwegians and that is a very bad thing to do with Norwegians. They hack the life out of Edward Snowden. They DDoS him so bad that a lot of his blood ends up on the outside of his body. They absolutely pwn his defenses by stabbing him with tiny helicopters. The screen turns back to Roberto’s face and he smirks and talks to the camera and the viewer thinks that this is the most amazing thing they had ever seen. How incredibly exciting! Alison shares an apple with her father and brother and they excrete their love hormone on each other. “Pleased to meet you.” They say this phrase for an hour. Father Roperto breaks his vows of celibacy and takes his own self into his hands. Chafing to oblivion, Father transcends into the cosmos. He sees the very beings that control the sun. While this happens, the little man’s procession ends and he is frozen in time. If only the same could be said about the universe. He slams into the moving and rotating Earth and perishes in the molten core. He is officially hacked. Roberto and Father and Sister are happy to have seen the hack happen. Roberto looks at the camera with a disinterested look of a true method actor and pontificates. Sister is gravid. Monster children are inside her. Fly hairs as light as fairy wings shoot out of her like a overstuffed and overhit pillow. Roberto turns away from the camera and says something snide. Roberto looks back at the camera and with the sincerity of a bored actor, says “Puffy cheese (trademark).”
