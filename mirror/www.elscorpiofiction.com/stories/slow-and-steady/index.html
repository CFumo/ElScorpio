<p><em>"In a world of anthropomorphic animals, two sloths get it on (bonus for a sloth orgy)." - Samantha Valasek</em><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Early morning at the Microsoft campus gym. Rick and Sandra are the only ones in the cardio room. Just two sloths looking to get fit before the midmorning rush.
</p>
<p>R: Today’s the day I’m hitting a bench PR, bro.
</p>
<p>S: Yeah? It certainly looks like it. You start the provo cycle?
</p>
<p>R: Fuck yeah. Also doing the Stanazolol.
</p>
<p>S: Isn’t that for the end of the cycle?
</p>
<p>R: Dude. That’s the usual thing, but Norm got an extra shipment this quarter. And this shit goes bad.
</p>
<p>S: Yeah dude. No reason to waste that juice.
</p>
<p>They down their pre-workout and start on the ellipticals.
</p>
<p>Minutes later, Jack Mouse wanders into the room.
</p>
<p>J: Heh. You sloths going fast on those running machines?
</p>
<p>S: Go fuck yourself, big-ears. Don’t harsh my flow.
</p>
<p>R: Are you fucking kidding me, rat motherfucker? That shit’s out of line, you racist piece of shit.
</p>
<p>J: Whoa whoa! It was just a joke! Just because you’re-
</p>
<p>R: A couple of sloths.
</p>
<p>J: A couple… yeah. Sloths.
</p>
<p>S: And sloths are slow.
</p>
<p>J: Well… yeah.
</p>
<p>S: You look here, vermin. If you think we’re so slow, you wouldn’t have a problem running out of this room from us, right?
</p>
<p>R: Because if we catch you, we’re gonna tear that tail off.
</p>
<p>S: But you’re not scared of that, right? We’re sloths, after all.
</p>
<p>J: Whoa whoa… hey guys, c’mon…
</p>
<p>S: Go fuck yourself, Jack. Get out before someone gets hurt.
</p>
<p>Jack scurries away to leave the two jacked sloths to finish their cardio in peace.
</p>
<p>Rick and Sandra spend the next two hours doing core, back, and arms. It is a fulfilling day at the weights. It is near 8 in the morning, and the two need to get to their morning scrums. But they need to get clean first.
</p>
<p>R: Good reps, man. Killing it with those head crushers!
</p>
<p>S: Yeah. I’m really feeling it. I KNEW you were gonna PR today!
</p>
<p>R: Holy shit, yeah. Finally broke 500!
</p>
<p>S: Siiiick!
</p>
<p>R: Aw, fuck, Sandra. Looks like the dude’s showers are closed for repair again.
</p>
<p>S: That sucks, man.
</p>
<p>R: Fuck, I gotta do a presentation in an hour. I won’t have time to BART home and back.
</p>
<p>S: Just use the chicks’ showers, bro!
</p>
<p>R: Hah. Yeah, I guess no one’s around. Let’s go. Cover for me!
</p>
<p>The two grab gym towels and head to the women’s locker room.
</p>
<p>S: Oh, there’s only one shower, bro. We’re gonna have to go together if we wanna make it to our meetings on time.
</p>
<p>R: Oh shit.
</p>
<p>S: Don’t be shy, dude!
</p>
<p>R: Ha! Alright.
</p>
<p>Sandra and Rick undress and hop into a stall. After minutes of lathering their furry sloth bodies, the ORGY begins.
</p>
<p>S: Oh, dude. Excited much?
</p>
<p>R: Yeah… It’s hard to not get hard when I see a beefcake like you undressed.
</p>
<p>S: You wanna… you wanna have a go at each other?
</p>
<p>R: Dude, yeah.
</p>
<p>S: Dude… yeah.
</p>
<p>Loyola and Emma, sloths from HR, are macking near the lockers when they hear the grunting coming from the single shower.
</p>
<p>L: What’s this I hear here?
</p>
<p>S: Loyola! Uhhh, there were just not enough showers and the guy’s room is closed and this is just really-
</p>
<p>L: Relaaaaax, baby. We’re just sloths in a locker room. You know what that means?
</p>
<p>E: Yeah. You know what that means?
</p>
<p>R: Slorgy?
</p>
<p>Everyone: Slorgy!
</p>
<p>Hours pass as the four sloths fuck each other silly. Here’s the thing about sloths. They’re only slow when it comes to getting tired of fuckin’.
</p>
<p>J: What’s all this, then?
</p>
<p>S: Fuck off, Jack!
</p>
<p>R: Wait wait wait… There aren’t enough dudes here. Maybe…
</p>
<p>S: Yeah… Jack. Get over here. We need more holes filled.
</p>
<p>J: I… I guess I can do that.
</p>
<p>E: You better, because you’ll get a write-up from HR if you don’t perform well!
</p>
<p>J: Really!?
</p>
<p>L: No, silly. Just come here and stick that tail as far up my ass as you can.
</p>
<p>They all had a really jolly good time.
