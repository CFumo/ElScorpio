		<div id='text'><p><p>Fear gripped Rebecca’s heart- a familiar sensation she had been feeling for over a fortnight. A fortnight trapped within the keep of the ancient dragon, Arron. The legendary Arron who broke the siege of Uthul the Glorious and made five thousand wives into widows with one deadly spell. The brutal Arron, whose dominion over Tund’ar resulted in a populace of mindflayed maniacs that completely annihilated each other within three generations. The enigmatic Arron that currently held the maiden Rebecca in a lavish cathedral where she was free to do as she pleased.
</p>
<p>This perplexing circumstance was the only thing that stopped Rebecca from flinging herself through any of the beautiful stained glass windows in her prison. And a paradisiacal prison it was- gorgeous stonework with an unusually comforting warmth on most surfaces, exotic rugs from the Eastlands made of gold thread and silk, lavish pools of bubbling water scented and colored by pleasant flowers and oils. These were the things Rebecca noticed as she woke up for the first time in her captivity. The necessities were also beyond anything she had ever seen. Her sleeping area was fit for a king with limitless wealth; rich purple and green hues made up the countless sheets and cushions. Soft to the touch, but made of materials that could resist frays and cuts. Veritable feasts for every meal served by ghostly, yet benevolent apparitions carrying out their duties to Arron.
</p>
<p>“How has your day been, Rebecca, daughter of James?”
</p>
<p>The inhuman voice didn’t startle the maiden as it had the first time she heard it. A sound akin to heavy stones moving against one another- a quake felt throughout the body. Without the mental projections of the words sent to Rebecca, she could have mistaken that voice for a thunderclash in the distance.
</p>
<p>The clenching fear sublimated into guarded joy. Truth be told, her fear was not of the formidable, terrifying, evil Arran. Rebecca feared the prospect of not seeing her captor- the tender, powerful, caring Arran. The courageous Arran who rescued Rebecca from her abusive betrothed, Eric the Unclean. The wise Arran that warned the maiden of the coming betrayal of her father at the hands of Eric’s people despite her political engagement. The passionate Arran, who made Rebecca feel more like a woman than any human she had lain with. The ancient dragon was a positive force in her life.
</p>
<p>Rebecca, who sat near the bathing pool, turned and faced the voice. Her joy rose to her blushing cheeks as she took in the silver figure standing just paces from her. A tall, muscled man with an unnatural silver shimmer that belied the color of his true form’s scales. He stood, barely clothed, with his hands outstretched and with a loving smile on his angular face. He held out a tattered quilt.
</p>
<p>“Is this truly what I think it is?” exclaimed the maiden. “The quilt my sister gave to me on my last name day!”
</p>
<p>“Indeed. I was able to save this before your family keep was completely ransacked by the Brennens, who raised Eric.”
</p>
<p>Rebecca shuddered at the reminder of her foul fiance. A slow look over Arran’s human form turned her mind away from the dark memories. She hadn’t seen the dragon in over a day, and her deprivation made her restless. Sensing her yearning, Arran stepped toward the lovely maiden. She mimed his movement and reached behind her to unlace her loose tunic. Arran’s strong hands slid around her now-barren waist and he leaned in for a kiss.
</p>
<p>“No,” Rebecca murmured. “Not like this. My body craves your true self- not a facsimile of a man. I want to feel the heat off your scales, the flex of your natural flesh.”
</p>
<p>“As you wish, my love.”
</p>
<p>Rebecca closed her eyes and felt the arms holding her expand, warm up, and become firmer. Claws- gentle, yet dangerous- caressed her quivering skin as they moved down. A puff of hot air washed over her as Arran huffed with slight strain. The young woman smiled and reached out. Her hands caressed the hard scales on the dragon’s back and the taut, sinewy muscles near his powerful joints. She opened her eyes. Though she asked for him to embody his true form, he only stood two heads above her- the size of a large stallion. She was glad- she knew that tonight they would finally make love. Much easier to do so when your lover is not the size of a citadel.
</p>
<p>The fair Rebecca took the fallen quilt and laid it out on the floor near where they stood. She kneeled with her inhuman lover, looking fondly at his angular draconic face. Arran growled with satisfaction as Rebecca lay her hands on his powerful neck. His growls turned to excitement when she started pushing his face to her yearning vulva. She caressed Arran’s blunted spines as his tongue caressed her pearl. Tonight would be a lovely night to remember.
