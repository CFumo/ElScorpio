		<div id='text'><p><p>I'm naked, and my hands are tied over my head, bound at the wrists. Before me stands the Virgin Mary. She is sparingly clad in diaphanous blue-and-white silk lingerie, in a blasphemous parody of her traditional garb. In her left hand she holds a riding crop.
</p>
<p>"Well Rachel," she says. "You've written a very naughty story about my Son, and I'm afraid you'll have to be punished."
</p>
<p>With the tip of the crop, she traces a teasing line between my breasts, but I ignore her advance.
</p>
<p>"Untie me," I say, voice even, expression solemn.
</p>
<p>For one second she looks like she might disobey. Then, of course, she relents. There is no cruelty in her; only mercy. She unbinds me, kissing my wrists where the rope has bitten me. I catch her face in my hands and tenderly kiss her unblemished brow. Then I take her into my arms. Passion ignites between us like a match to paper. We tumble to the ground in an expressionless moment of lips and hands, tasting, caressing, my mouth on her skin and her arching into me at the feel of my lips. I grab handfuls of her breasts and thighs, maddened by the curvaceous lustful <em>weight</em> of her beautiful body. Our legs tangle together as we grind against each other in a delirium of arousal.
</p>
<p>"Please," she begs, "please, more, I need more."
</p>
<p>I slick my fingers against the moist folds between her legs, preparing to slip them inside her—but I can't do it. I can't tarnish this unwilling paragon of womanly virtue, can't spoil the chaste worldliness of her uninvaded body. She's perfect—the perfect, virginal childqueen saviormother, the victim of a strange Catholic alchemy. She is the matron and the maid. And I, clearly, the crone, full of lecherous secrets and dark magic.
</p>
<p>She clutches at me, writhing beneath me, pleading, begging, needing more, hungry for more because release isn't <em>enough</em>, welling over with a wolfish, poisonous lust, forever praying for our sins but never to know for herself the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. And I, powerless to ease her craving, both of us trapped by this suffocating patriarchal arbitration. I can feel how <em>warped</em> I am by it and I hate myself, and I hate her, and I hate every man who ever wore a robe and waxed rhapsodic about the sins of the flesh, and I hate the first fish that first fucked in the first ocean and damned us to this absurd Darwinian game of coy, enfortressed sexuality.
</p>
<p>For the thousandth time I wish I was a man, so I could put my penis inside her and fuck her until she begged me to stop. I wish I was a child again so I could bury my face in her breasts and sob, and she would stroke my hair and whisper "It's ok love, it's ok love." I think of every church I've ever been in and every musty pew-lined corridor where the weight of God's silence pressed down on me from where it filled the vaulted ceiling, and I think of every little alcove I've ever peered into and every statue of the Virgin holding her arms out to me, of the Virgin weeping over the broken body of her Son.
</p>
<p>We're still rocking against each other, still whimpering and pawing each other, fueled by our need and my rage. There is no rage in her. She is in incapable of it.
</p>
<p>"Beautiful Virgin," I murmur against her throat. She sighs my name. "Oh star of the sea." I know she'll disappear once the story ends. I clutch her to me. I don't want to lose her. I love her. I love her so much.
</p></p></div>
