		<div id='text'><p><p>Mr. Mouse sat in his car with a hunch and a frown. His paws tightened on the steering wheel. His whiskers twitched. He stared intently at the shining taillights in front of him.
</p>
<p>Mr. Mouse was stuck in traffic. Mr. Mouse hated traffic.
</p>
<p>He muttered to himself, “There are too many creatures in this city. The traffic is terrible. And I am so angry.”
</p>
<p>Once Mr. Mouse’s car finally rolled to a stop in front of his office, he shuffled inside, sighing grumpily.
</p>
<p>Mr. Elephant greeted him from behind the front desk,  “Good morning, Mr. Mouse! What seems to be the matter?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, Mr. Elephant, there are too many creatures in this city. The traffic is terrible. And I am so angry,” Mr. Mouse replied.
</p>
<p>“Aye, it is indeed,” Mr. Elephant agreed, “But I do not mind it so much. When I am sitting alone in traffic, I can listen to my favorite music in peace. You should try listening to music while you drive.”
</p>
<p>Mr. Mouse was not a big music fan, but he did not want to argue. He mumbled his thanks to Mr. Elephant and continued into the hall. There he passed by Mrs. Rhino, who asked, “Why the frown, Mr. Mouse?”
</p>
<p>He bristled in reply, “There are too many creatures in this city, Mrs. Rhino. The traffic is terrible. And I am so angry.”
</p>
<p>“Oh? Has it been bad?” Mrs. Rhino trilled. “I did not even notice. I talk to my sister on speakerphone every morning. It makes my commute so lovely. You should find someone to talk to while you drive.”
</p>
<p>Mr. Mouse thought this idea was not very safe, but he did not want to argue. He nodded politely to Mrs. Rhino and trundled into the break room. As he was placing his lunch in the refrigerator, Miss Sparrow sauntered in and chirped, “What a beautiful day! But dear me, Mr. Mouse, look at your sour face. What ever is the problem?”
</p>
<p>Mr. Mouse explained himself again, “There are too many creatures in this city. The traffic is terrible. And I am so angry, Miss Sparrow.”
</p>
<p>“Huh, is that all?” Miss Sparrow piped, “I leave extra early and have some time to relax in my office before work. I even have time for coffee and a crossword puzzle. You should leave earlier if you dislike the traffic so much.”
</p>
<p>Mr. Mouse knew that if he left any earlier he would not get to see his children in the morning, but he did not want to argue. He waved to Miss Sparrow as he exited the room and marched sullenly to his office.
</p>
<p>He sat at his desk with a hunch and a frown. His paw tightened around his pen. His whiskers twitched. He glared furiously at the piles of paper in front of him.
</p>
<p>A knock came at the door and Mr. Bear popped his head inside.
</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Mr. Mouse. Do you have a moment?” Mr. Bear inquired delicately.
</p>
<p>“What is it?” Mr. Mouse snapped.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bear waited at the door as he spoke, “I do not mean to intrude, but I heard that you may be having a rough day. I was wondering if you wanted to talk about it.”
</p>
<p>Mr. Mouse was tired of advice, but he did not want to be rude. His voice sounded weary as he repeated, “There are too many creatures in this city. The traffic is terrible. And I am so angry.”
</p>
<p>Mr. Bear stepped into the office and closed the door. “I see,” he said. “The terrible traffic makes you angry. I can understand that.”
</p>
<p>“Thank you!” Mr. Mouse cried. “No one else seems to understand.”
</p>
<p>“That must make you angry too,” said Mr. Bear.
</p>
<p>“Well, yes.” Mr. Mouse’s ears drooped. “It also makes me a little sad. It feels like they are not listening.”
</p>
<p>“I am so sorry you feel that way, Mr. Mouse. Is there anything I can do to help?”
</p>
<p>“No, Mr. Bear, but thank you very much for asking.” Mr. Mouse chuckled softly, “I do not think there is anything you can do about the traffic.”
</p>
<p>Mr. Bear shook his head and smiled, “You are right about that. I have no magic wand.”
</p>
<p>Mr. Mouse took a big breath and let it out slowly. “I guess I can think of a way to handle this myself. I really appreciate your thoughtfulness, Mr. Bear. At least I do not feel like I am stuck in traffic anymore. I just needed to express myself and feel heard.”
</p>
<p>“Anytime,” promised Mr. Bear as he stood to leave. “I hope your day gets better.”
</p>
<p>“It already has,” Mr. Mouse grinned.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bear smiled warmly and headed out the door.
</p>
<p>Mr. Mouse turned back to his work with a quick stretch and a smile. His paw loosened around his pen. His whiskers relaxed. He focused calmly on the first page in front of him.
</p>
<p>-----
</p>
<p>That night after a pleasant dinner with his wife and children, Mr. Mouse turned on his computer and looked up the bus schedule.
</p>
<p>The End
