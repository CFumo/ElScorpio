Things get heated, then things get steamy as their attempts to demonstrate on each other how the situations would go ignite their passions."</i> - Tim Berteaux</em><br>

<p>"The question was What two characters would you want to fuck. I answered. The guy got mad. Im glad he got mad." -Anonymous, 2014
</p>
<p>
	Dr. Jemamenina Gloria Day Jefferson-Fuertes Petersburghstein wanted to invite Nina J. over to discuss a matter that had dragged on for much too long. It was coming up on a month of long nights spent on hundreds, now possibly in the thousands, of intricately detailed point-by-point, clearly stated, Thesaurus-assisted, Google-empowered, Merriam-Webster-referenced, Copyscape-checked, mathe-fucking-matically proven explanations of what would be the greatest single most awesomely epic and fantastically, no, no no, PRODIGIOUSLY beautiful fictional relationship between characters of early '90s ABC dramas. Online posts were clearly of no use in getting the message across.
</p>
<p>Jemma carefully adjusted her full-rim cat-eye glasses and inspected herself carefully in the full-length mirror sat next to her fulldome workstation. Her purple pantsuit sparkled in the powerful glare of the sun. Her 49GG chest threatened to upend her miniscule but thick 5'1" 90lbs 49-26-49 frame. Strands of naturally wavy turquoise shimmered when she brushed her hand lightly through as she contemplated calling up J to set the record straight once and for all.
</p>
<p>"I must!" she yelped, and looked around to make sure nobody heard that sudden ejaculation. She got her nondescript new phone from between her boobs and tried to find the phone app. After googling how to make a call, she got Nina's personalized jazzy dialtone sounding on the tinny speaker.
</p>
<p>"Hello who's this?"
</p>
<p>"Hi Nina, it's Gloria here."
</p>
<p>"Gloria?"
</p>
<p>"Oh. JemmeJatale?"
</p>
<p>"Oh, hi."
</p>
<p>"Hi, so.. I wanted to discuss our, well, our... our.."
</p>
<p>"Debate?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, I wouldn't want to call it a debate, per se, but yes that's quite near to my intended description of our long-standing discussion I would say."
</p>
<p>"Ok."
</p>
<p>"Right, so.."
</p>
<p>"You, like, want to do it over the phone then?"
</p>
<p>"Oh, absolutely not, I don't think a phone conversation is well suited to providing the context necessary and the social cues that facilitate a lively and detailed discussion of matters."
</p>
<p>"Right. So.."
</p>
<p>"So, I'll arrange for us to meet up. Caroline will be there in no time at all to pick you up."
</p>
<p>"What?"
</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I saw your schedule is clear for today. I've additionally gone ahead and made sure you're available for tomorrow and Tuesday. I hope that's okay. It should be a comfortable ride out west, Richard is an absolutely excellent pilot. His landings are the smoothest in the country, by far. Oh, by far. He's not yours to have, by the way."
</p>
<p>"What?"
</p>
<p>"Just go ahead and meet your driver. You're comfortable with this arrangement?"
</p>
<p>"Uh. I'm really not sure about this."
</p>
<p>"Oh, it'll be fun. The view from this building is unmatched, it'll provide a wonderful backdrop, if a little contrasting."
</p>
<p>"Huh? What? Uh. What building? Wait, what contrast? What?"
</p>
<p>"The Empire State. Well, I am mostly considering the fact that our discussion has involved characters which do not at all associate with metropolitan nor even urban ideals, of course."
</p>
<p>"Oh, of course. Huh. Well, it-"
</p>
<p>"6 hours, Nina. I'll be expecting you. How does sushi sound?"
</p>
<p>"O-ok. It sounds fine?"
</p>
<p>"Great. Now how do I- [...] Oh, there we-"
</p>
<p>Nina's slender A-cup frame was a sweaty mess. Was she really going to drop everything, travel to New York to meet up with JemmeJatale just to discuss how wrong she was about ABC's Homefront's Ginger Szabo's motivations? Goddammit, she's so wrong!
</p>
<p>~ ~ ~
</p>
<p>"Okay, let me just get comfortable here for a moment before you demonstrate Ginger's -as you assert- furtively intimate character," Gloria voiced sardonically as she laid on her Freudian couch.
</p>
<p>"Oh my God, she is! Just look, while her public outer shell is obviously hardened by her depression-era childhood and she may look like an outspoken and assertive personality in everyday life, her intimate moments would reveal a much more reserved person."
</p>
<p>"But she is hardly more reserved than Annie. She's like the ultimate shy girl."
</p>
<p>"Yes she is, I'm telling you! Ms. Blackburn allows herself much more freedom with people who she allows inside her personal sphere. So, for like the billionth time, Ms. Szabo is a total bottom, and thus Blackburn will always be on top."
</p>
<p>"But none of your statements prove that."
</p>
<p>"What will prove it, then? Look, I'll show you. I'll be Szabo and you'll be Blackburn. You'll see how it will perfectly match their development and inner life."
</p>
<p>They then proceeded to have massive amounts of lesbian sex on that couch there, it was pretty crazy.
