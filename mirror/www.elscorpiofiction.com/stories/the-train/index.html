		<div id='text'><p><p>Her life was moving so quickly. She didn’t feel it though. It was almost as if she were on a moving train that was taking her, free of charge, to an unnamed, unknown destination. She was just going along for the ride; mostly because she wasn’t sure of an exit route.
</p>
<p>Before she knew it, her hands had become soft and papery; they had grown light with wear and multicolored with use. Her smile was the same, but the wrinkles around it had grown more definite. There was a change in how she dealt with her problems, and how she saw the world, though her eyes themselves were unchanged save for the crow’s feet.
</p>
<p>She was still living, no doubt. Her life was filled with events and projects. Her children and friends surrounded her when she needed them. Her interactions had changed but that was a side effect of age and experience. It almost seemed that along with her skin, the world had also lost some of its color. Of course it did, the trees and flowers had been overrun with buildings and parking lots. Of course the color was gone, it wasn’t coming back.
</p>
<p>Her job and obligations moved her past all this; it did not do to dwell. She’d learned this long ago. She didn’t mind where her life had taken her, though she could hardly look back and piece together a cohesive story, overall she was happy…content…satisfied, if slightly overwhelmed. She didn’t think she’d done much wrong, didn’t hurt anyone if she could help it. She knew who she was.
</p>
<p>On the eve of her 63rd birthday she stepped into the metro on the way home from work, and the man behind her was being pushed by the many other bodies on the train. He moved close enough to where she could smell the leftover musky cologne on his shirt, and almost hear the song through his headphones. A song she hadn’t heard in years. The train jolted and her breath stalled. She had become a girl of 15 again. Transported in her mind and heart completely, she saw the ambitions, morals, and hopes of that girl of 15, and felt uncontrollable tears stream down her face.
