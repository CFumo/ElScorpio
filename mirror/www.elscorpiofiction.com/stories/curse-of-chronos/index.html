		<div id='text'><p><p>The ability to see the future was originally a little limited, which made it seem harmless. Firstly, the spatial coordinates seemed fixed to the origin, rather than the device. Secondly, the field between here and there was impenetrable, save for some light. So your vision was limited to a screen into outer space for most of the time. The only upside was seeing the inside of stars if you were lucky with your future estimates, and seeing the inevitable heat death of the Universe. You couldn't light anything up and black holes broke the field.
</p>
<p>After science was done with it, there was very little use. The military didn't want it. The private sector save a few in the niche market couldn't move it. The patent expired and nobody cared. Well, about a dozen enthusiasts and institutions were happy about that.
</p>
<p>We don't know who invented the device. At the End of Unknowns, no secret was left untold, unless it was destroyed and forgotten, with no trace of it left. That appears to have been the case here. I couldn't tell you why they went to such lengths to erase that bit of information. We know every other detail about it. We now know it started as a project in Area 51, that UFO place in America. We know who managed it, what companies supplied the components. We know who applied for the patent when they moved it into daylight. But they thoroughly scrubbed the inventor from existence. It was like he didn't exist.
</p>
<p>Due to a lack of interest in the device, it took half a century to figure out that you can point the screen literally anywhere you want from present on. Suddenly everyone was interested. Thousands of people got themselves one. Most of the screens were swiftly confiscated after a quick and sweeping ban. And that was the end of the world as we knew it. Some people now had total knowledge of everything that would ever happen on Earth.
</p>
<p>This was apparently enough to send the economy into a tailspin. Nobody attempted speculation, someone out there knew the exact conditions. You wouldn't make a bet against a guy who knows your hand, would you? Mass paranoia set in while people hunted for the ones who now stood to benefit from every known unknown and unknown unknown from now to eternity. Very few were apprehended, as they benefitted from the near-total information, thwarting every move.
</p>
<p>Seeing the need to cooperate, the seers formed a guild quickly and eliminated outsiders. That guild, assuming the role of beneficial dictators, took over the executive with a small fight and a little later became world leaders without any bloodshed.
</p>
<p>A few years later everyone had a screen. I don't mean everyone who could afford one. Literally everyone with a pulse got one, by decree of the seers. So now everyone's a seer. Well, it turns out that was the apex of our civilization. Somehow the screens had the same paradoxical effect on invention as they had on the economy. The seers thought it had to do with the inherent information imbalance they brought. But the future doesn't change.
