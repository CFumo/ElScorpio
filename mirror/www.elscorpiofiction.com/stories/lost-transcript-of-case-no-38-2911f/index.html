		<div id='text'><p><p>A: What more do you want.
</p>
<p>B: The truth
</p>
<p>A: (scoffs) Truth? You’re a fucking coward, you don’t want the truth.
</p>
<p>B: No need for that kind of language. What makes you think so?
</p>
<p>A: White Male American. Special Services. Privileged. Wealthy. Comfortable. All you want is for me to confess so you can go back home to your wife and daughter.
</p>
<p>B: How did you kn-
</p>
<p>A: Nevermind. Now tell me what you want.
</p>
<p>B: Why did you do it?
</p>
<p>A: Why?
</p>
<p>B: If what you’re saying is true, these are your own people, your family, your frie-
</p>
<p>A: (whispers) Don’t you say for a second that these are my own fucking people. Don’t you turn this on me like that.
</p>
<p>B: Language please. Now, aren’t they? You grew up here.
</p>
<p>A: Did I?
</p>
<p>B: It’s in the file.
</p>
<p>A: “It’s in the file” Can I ask you a question? How old is your daughter?
</p>
<p>B: That information is irrelevant to this discu-
</p>
<p>A: Was she born here?
</p>
<p>B: Wha-
</p>
<p>A: Do you have big dreams for her? Maybe she’ll grow up to be a physician, a lawyer, maybe even president.
</p>
<p>B: (losing patience) You keep her out of this!
</p>
<p>A: What if I told you she was going to be a terrorist?
</p>
<p>(B stops and stares piercingly at A, livid, terrified, shaking)
</p>
<p>(A smiles slightly)
</p>
<p>A: You know what I wanted to be when I grew up
</p>
<p>(silence)
</p>
<p>A: I wanted to be a photographer. I wanted to document the way people lived and interacted with each other.
</p>
<p>B: (losing his patience-raising his voice) I don’t give a damn about your childhood aspirations. WHY DID YOU DO IT?
</p>
<p>A: Language! (laughs softly, menacingly) Of course you don’t. My mistake…I forget sometimes that no one gives a damn. So why am I here? Nothing I say is going to change your mind. So take me now. Death penalty, life in prison, nothing I say makes a damn difference.
</p>
<p>B: Just give your confession so we can end this.
</p>
<p>A: Say I confess. Say I plead guilty. What then? You kill me, or the memory of me in whatever way suits you best. Then? Weeks pass, maybe months, and another attack goes off. Same story, “innocents” murdered in the name of some ideal, and another maybe guilty maybe not Muslim gets the same sentence as me and again the hate and fear increases. Yet you won’t listen, you’ll let this continue because of convenience. And that’s what we want. Because unlike you, we don’t forget.
</p>
<p>B: You’re planning more attacks? With who? Where
</p>
<p>A: How did you celebrate your daughter’s 8th birthday?
</p>
<p>B: I told you to leave her out of this. Who specifically are you working with? I need names.
</p>
<p>A: Would have been nice. Would have been nice to have my Abba at my 8th birthday party.
</p>
<p>B: We don’t have time for this.
</p>
<p>A: I’m trying to help you.
</p>
<p>B: Bullshit. You killed seven innocent people and injured who knows how many more and you show no signs of remorse. And you’re trying to help me? I’m not your therapist.
</p>
<p>A: You said you wanted to know why. Or did you forget that already?
</p>
<p>B: How do you all do it?
</p>
<p>A: You all?
</p>
<p>B: Yea all of you! People who will harass and kill hundreds of people a day because they’re not like you. Religious intolerance, stripping people of freedom.
</p>
<p>A: My father was shot driving a taxi cab on Thanksgiving in 2001. Right here, in town. I was born here, but he was born in a little town by Morocco. He moved here when he was my age and worked hard and this country gave him everything. He loved it here; he even kept a little American flag out on our porch.  He’d been driving that taxi for 14 years, and Thanksgiving day, this asshole gets in, asks my Abba’s ethnicity in casual conversation, mocks the prophet and proceeds to shoot my father in the head. ..Religious intolerance.
