		<div id='text'><p><p>I was born at the beginning of the good year of 1990, only a day before the first McDonald’s opened up in Russia. Coincidentally, the day before my birth was marked with the trial of an Exxon Valdez boat operator. I guess good things come in threes.
</p>
<p>I don’t remember much of my stay at the medical facility in Anchorage, Alaska, but I was told that, had my parents wanted to, they could have sold me to a local township for two narwhals. I’m glad they didn’t, as that particular town was known to use female infants as high-grade chum for industrial fishing. Seriously, people of Chignik, stop doing that. Not a good thing to be known for.
</p>
<p>My first memory was of the plane ride to southern California. I distinctly recall waking up, making sure my parents were asleep during the red-eye flight, and throwing a punch at the old lady sitting next to us. I was only a day old, but the flight attendants were sure that the octogenarian had smashed her face on the hard seat-back in front of her. My first victory against the great foe- humanity.
</p>
<p>Not many people know this, but babies can’t speak. The Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas aren’t developed enough until a later time. However, some babies can scheme. I spent the first three months in Los Angeles very busy scheming. Torture inventions, spells to cripple, Ponzi schemes, best methods to strong-arm bank tellers. You name it, I had schemed it. Of course, I couldn’t scheme in front of my parents, or their guests. I had to do it in the deep of night, while the moon was out and the neighbors were dead asleep. I was praised for being a quiet baby, but that’s only because I was too exhausted from my scheming to cry about shitting myself or wanting to eat.
</p>
<p>The routine changed when my father, a luthier by day and Lutheran priest by night, purchased the family our first color television. This was a distraction from scheming. I saw the world, the wondrous colors and spectacles. I pretended to be asleep when my parents turned on the evening news. My birth mother, a police officer, was keen on watching science shows, the ones that described warfare and weaponry. As I espied these new ideas, I knew that there was much more to the world than simple scheming. I had to connect with others- to connive, to collude, and to conspire. I knew how to build a pipe bomb by the age of ½, but I had tiny baby ham hands that couldn’t handle a screw driver. I needed accomplices.
</p>
<p>My needs cultivated my education. I learned to speak by 7 months and to read encoded messages at 8 months. Reading normal books came a couple of weeks later. I was especially fond of The Lorax. Not the eponymous Lorax, but of the rapacious society described in the childhood guide to creating resource shortages. My first letters to the newly built Pelican Bay Supermax prison were returned, as I’d not been named yet, and no prison correspondences could be anonymous. I couldn’t wait until my naming ceremony on the anniversary of my spawning.
