</p>
<p><em>"An exorcism takes a bizarre turn when the administering priest decides to try meeting the demon's demands." - Cosmo Fumo</em><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Father Anthony wiped his forehead with the back of the hand that gripped the crucifix. His throat burned as he hurled yet another strained volley:
</p>
<p>“Be gone, demon! Heaven’s light reveals the wickedness of your deceit. You are seen! We are witness to the profanities you have wrought. Our Lord, has gifted us with the wisdom to acknowledge evil and exorcise it. No place on Earth can hide you from the eyes of God’s humble servants. Infernal adversary, release this innocent vessel and return to the fires whence you came!”
</p>
<p>Rising further into the air, the haunted child issued a devious laugh and assumed the casual repose of an ancient prince. In tones of velvet and ice, she replied, “Your labors are futile, holy man. No virtue is rewarded by a demon; not patience, nor diligence, nor charity, nor chastity. This prize is mine. Unless…”
</p>
<p>The priest had heard of the tricks of Satan and his kind and anticipated this turn towards negotiation.
</p>
<p>“Unless?”
</p>
<p>“Unless you would accept a trade. I have a very reasonable exchange in mind.”
</p>
<p>Father Anthony tugged at his collar and swallowed hard. The adversary’s wit demanded caution. “What do you…what kind of exchange?”
</p>
<p>A smirk flashed across the little girl’s face before her body drifted to the ground, then collapsed. A vaporous shadow spilled from her mouth and nostrils and filled the room. The servant of God fell to his knees and groped through the blackness for the child. He pulled her towards him, putting his ear to her mouth. Her breathing was weak, but she was breathing. Relief flooded his body. Then, he stiffened as a form emerged from the dissipating dark.
</p>
<p>“And now to make a deal with the devil,” he thought as he rose to meet his antagonist.
</p>
<p>A woman stood before him, pretty and simply clothed in a gray frock. She spoke with elegance, “I will loose this child’s soul from Lucifer’s grasp upon one condition: you accompany me to hell and taste of the torment therein. After you have sipped from the cup of hell, you only need form the thought and you will be immediately returned to your earthly life. You have the Word of My Lord.”
</p>
<p>He took the measure of the demon as he considered her offer. She appeared soft as an angel. Gentle waves of chestnut hair fell across slender shoulders. Her modest dress covered a full bosom, hugged a slim waist, then draped delicately down to ankles from the round curve of hips. Rosy hands waited patiently at her sides. The only trace of hardness was in the glint of her eye.
</p>
<p>A temptress if he ever saw one, she revealed no evil in her physicality.
</p>
<p>“What do you mean, a ‘taste?’”
</p>
<p>“You must only gain a glimpse of understanding. You will know when the knowledge has dawned. For how could you not? And then, you are free, free to leave hell as you please.”
</p>
<p>The holy man closed his eyes. He saw no alternative. “I accept.”
</p>
<p>“Wonderful.” Her whisper caressed him like a summer breeze.
</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes, he was no longer in the child’s nursery. Everything was bright. All around him were clouds. And at a small distance there were pearly gates. The woman beckoned him from the other side of the gates. However, she was not wearing the humble gown. She was naked as a freshly molted snake. He strode forward with curiosity and only upon reaching her noticed his own bareness. He did not feel shame.
</p>
<p>“Come, Anthony,” she called with an outstretched arm. “Come learn what you are here to learn.”
</p>
<p>He took her hand and allowed himself to be led, wondering what tortures he would endure. They walked until a palace of light and shadow arose from the horizon. She smiled as she sauntered forth. Bracing for pain, he crossed the threshold with his breath held.
</p>
<p>The demon stepped back to reveal a fuller view. Inside was a great room filled with all manner of people engaged in all manner of embrace. The scene seemed to undulate with concupiscence. Couples, threesomes, dodecasomes and more pulsed in infinite combinations. His breath came short as he took a step backward and felt his back meet with his chaperon’s breasts. She slid one hand across his chest and the other towards his pelvis. He felt his manhood stir in response, the dawn of knowledge.
</p>
<p>“Man of virtue, you appear ready to learn.”
</p>
<p>“I suppose. That is why I am here.” He attempted evenness although he was wholly unnerved. It was not that he was a virgin. No, it was that the man could hardly contain his yearning. His carnal need opened from deep within.
</p>
<p>“Well, then.” Her lips barely parted. “Touch me.”
</p>
<p>The command was met with no hesitation. He wrapped his fingers around the hand that caressed the crest of his hip and guided it to his erect length. Their fingers entwined as they moved from base to tip in a smooth mounting rhythm. Fire erupted from the pit of his being and bathed his body in rich warmth. He reached with his other hand to draw her face to his and kissed the corner of her lips with urgent tenderness. She returned his energies and pressed her stomach into the small of his back, her mound against his buttocks. Their bodies flowed together, rocking and grinding for what could have been days in this place without time. Finally, she pulled herself in front and then on top of him as they descended on pillow-soft ground.
</p>
<p>“Touch me,” she demanded as she leaned over him on all fours.
</p>
<p>He responded instinctually, hungrily, clasping her hips in both hands and directing them until he could reach a nipple with his mouth.
</p>
<p>Father Anthony tasted hell. He learned the voraciousness of man’s appetites, the emptiness in his pleasures, and the weakness of his will. Yet, as millennia flung themselves across eternity, Father Anthony never thought to leave.
