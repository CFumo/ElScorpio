		<div id='text'><p><p>Connie began to have a demon problem in May of 2016.
</p>
<p>"I think they're coming in under the heater or something," she told her friend Lucy.
</p>
<p>"Maybe they're crawling up through the plumbing?"
</p>
<p>"Can they do that?"
</p>
<p>"I dunno, maybe."
</p>
<p>At first she just found the occasional dead demon on her kitchen floor. She saw little discs of demon poison under her kitchen sink and figured it was doing its job. But then she started seeing them in other parts of her apartment, and she had the unsavory task of catching and killing them.
</p>
<p>"Windex?"
</p>
<p>"Yeah shit I just Windex 'em," said Lucy. "It messes up their respiratory system or something."
</p>
<p>The last straw for Connie was when a demon crawled out from between the couch cushions right next to her. She called the landlady to complain.
</p>
<p>"Sorry about that sweetie. I'll call the exorcists, they should come by next Wednesday to pray around the building."
</p>
<p>On June 21, Connie got a voicemail from her landlady saying there was a scheduling error and the exorcists couldn't come until next week. But by then the nature of the problem had changed. Two nights prior, Connie was up late reading when one of the demons whispered to her. She spoke with it for hours.
