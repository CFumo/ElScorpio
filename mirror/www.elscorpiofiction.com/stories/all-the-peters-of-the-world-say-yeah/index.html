		<div id='text'><p><p>Peter sat on the sofa across from Peter, his girlfriend Peter and their son Peter while Peter, Peter's dog, slept upstairs. They sat mostly in silence while waiting for Peter, Peter's mother, to get back from the hospital where Peter, Peter's cousin was recovering from gunshot wounds.<br>
</p>
<p>Peter had been warned by Peter who confronted him when he saw Peter run out of the house with his new friend, Peter, who Peter knew to be involved with some bad people. Needless to say, Peter ignored Peter's only warning Peter had ever given Peter in his entire life. Peter wasn't known to even dole out advice unless specifically asked, and even then he was hesitant.
</p>
<p>Peter stood up and walked to the window facing the street. He sighed and, thinking of his brother, said "Globalisation has not shown itself to be a force for democratization nor equality," pensively. His eyes followed a car that drove suspiciously slow up the street. He lost interest when he saw the driver was a teenager, probably on her way from soccer practice down the street.
</p>
<p>Peter, rarely one to engage in conversation, but feeling the silence this time too deafening, attempted to lift the mood, if for a second, "I got this sudden obsession for pastels the other day, but now my wife thinks I don't know how to use the washing machine."
</p>
<p>Peter looked back at Peter and smiled, about to say something  when the wind had started again, and the neighbor's dog barked, which prompted Peter to wake up and bark in turn. "We aim to transform the way society interacts with the Northern Lights, and bring humanity to a brighter and greener future," Peter offered when Peter was done barking. The neighbor's dog would continue barking, but Peter usually tired himself out before he got irritating to anyone.
</p>
<p>"Gorkunerchune herperbebe?" Peter asked as she stood up to get beers from the fridge. She could sure take the edge off. "You need a website. Why not do it yourself?" Peter asked her. "Work will set you free," she answered and went to get Peter and herself beers.
</p>
<p>A few minutes of silence passed. Again it became unbearable for Peter, who sniggered and said, "Like I had personally done something to deserve closing the store out by myself," incredulously. Peter shushed Peter. She didn't like that story. She didn't like when people told her stories of their youth. "He was looking over some data packages the distributed network had sent back," she chastised him. "America is a melting pot of cultures," he shot back. "America is a word salad of ideas," she hastily chided.
</p>
<p>"Get 20% off your first pair if you sign up today!" Peter interjected, hoping that would end their increasingly hostile discussion. "yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes don't stop," Peter shrugged and started considering why he had offered to wait with them for Peter to get back. He hardly knew Peter. But Peter is family. Fine.
</p>
<p>"In an effort to relieve themselves of the cognitive dissonance an educated viewpoint creates, people will typically become pigheaded," Peter was quick to change the conversation. Peter always appreciated how quick she was to segue from a potential hotzone into cool civilized discussion. So natural it came, too, that Peter already forgot all about her issue she had with Peter and quickly yelled back, "And then I said, "You're going to buy some? What about the other ducks!" Hahaha!"
</p>
<p>Peter couldn't help but smile. There they sat, despite all their conflicts, personal loathing, disdain for each others flaws and found company. "You are the Trump to my Putin, the goat to my milk," Peter said taking a beer from Peter. Peter locked eyes with Peter. "It's true, fundamentalists don't like nihilism. They also don't like people who seem to think the void is an exotic tourist destination," she almost whispered. Peter glanced out the window and saw Peter coming down the street. "terrorize that üê±" he announced to the room.
