		<div id='text'><p><p>Clementine was panicking. He couldn’t remember how long he’d been in this blizzard nor why he would have come outside in the dead of night. He couldn’t shake the sense of urgency that pervaded his thoughts. His mind was racing with gibberish. He was terrified of the chaotic void that lay beyond the light of his lantern, and even more terrified of the dark figure that stood in front of him. It loomed just beyond the light like a specter teasing him from encroaching shadows. He felt compelled to approach it. The snow was thick and grabbed at his feet. The space between him and the shape seemed to lengthen as he stumbled through the frost, longing to know what the figure was. At long last the light from his lantern reached the figure; it was a snowman! Clementine felt the warmth of Christmas Spirit ease his tiny heart. He crossed the remaining distance and circled to the front of the snowman to see its face. And then his heart stopped. There was no face; only a circular black maw. It seemed bigger than the head within which it sat. It began to scream. A piercing, shrieking horror that sounded like something dying in agony.
</p>
<p>Clementine awoke screaming in terror. The sound from his nightmare seemed to trail off into reality, as if it had been made by some animal in the distance. He looked around; it was Christmas Morning and there was a light snow falling outside, but it was eerily quiet. He saw no one and heard none of the expected revelry. Something was wrong. There was another noise outside. A pained, haunting moan. It sounded like a dying animal. Clementine began to stand up on his bed to look out of the window when the door to his room flew open—it was his good friend Snowball. He slammed the door and locked it in a frenzied, chaotic motion. “Be quiet,” the elf whispered, with a look of terror that Clementine didn’t recognize. “Santa is coming.”
</p>
<p>---
</p>
<p>The two elves hid under Clementine’s bed in silence for three hours before Snowball felt safe enough to explain what was happening.
</p>
<p>“Last night you went to sleep before Santa came back, right?”
</p>
<p>“Yeah, there were only a few thousand houses left so I thought-” started Clementine, but Snowball cut him off.
</p>
<p>“Something happened out there. I don’t know what it was but it was real bad. Santa called off the delivery. He came straight back from that house-”
</p>
<p>“He WHAT?” Interjected Clementine. “Santa would never abandon children on Christmas!”
</p>
<p>“This was different, Clem. There was something wrong. Something happened… I…  I don’t know what. All I know is that he pulled into the shop with a vacant stare like he’d seen some…  thing. We tried to ask him what happened… what he saw… but… he wouldn’t speak-”
</p>
<p>Their hushed conversation was cut short by another scream. Clementine was sure now. This was the sound of elves dying. He was beside himself with terror.
</p>
<p>“Oh god, he’s getting closer. Look, we already tried giving him cookies and milk, we tried Jingle Bells and Deck The Halls…  nothing worked. That’s when we noticed that some of the reindeer were missing-”
</p>
<p>“Missing!?” Screamed Clementine, before covering his mouth in horror.
</p>
<p>“That’s not even the worst of it! Oh god… Clem… I’m so sorry to have to tell you this. Santa… Santa had a bite mark on his neck.”
</p>
<p>Clementine whimpered through his clasped hands. A teardrop welled in his eye.
</p>
<p>“He was bleeding profusely. He was trying to hide it… or maybe he forgot. I didn’t know what to do! We patched him up of course. Christmas bandages and a candy cane and everything! We thought maybe… that maybe if he slept it off he’d be back to normal… but… but…” Snowball began sobbing.
</p>
<p>“What happened, Snowball? What happened this morning?”
</p>
<p>“He… He… Oh god Clem he ate them. Forest and Sixpence went to wake him up with some hot cocoa but he was crazy. He attacked them and started eating them like some kind of animal!”
</p>
<p>Clementine couldn’t understand what he was hearing. Santa Claus was a demigod. Of course this was some kind of joke. But he had never seen Snowball like this before. Something distracted him from his thoughts; a sound. Some horrible scraping sound… Something was scratching on the door.
</p>
<p>“He’s here,” Snowball said in a grave whisper. The elf produced a sleek black shape from his pocket. Clementine had never seen a real gun before, but he knew what it was immediately.
</p>
<p>The scratching at the door stopped. There was a faint jingling sound. Bells. The fire in the fireplace was out. Clementine felt a creeping coldness enter the room from the chimney. Snowball looked him in the eyes.
</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry Clementine. I’m so sorry. Merry Christmas my dear friend.”
</p>
<p>Weeping, Snowball put the barrel of the gun to Clementine’s forehead, closed his eyes, and pulled the trigger.
