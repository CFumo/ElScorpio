</p>
<p>Detailed to the Public for the First Time by Alexander Gomez, GMTS
</p>
<p><em><br></em>
</p>
<p><em>Once Upon a Midnight Dreary</em><br>
</p>
<p>The study of Abyssal Magic was brought into being in the fourth floor Real Matter study room of Hollendurk Technical Magic University. On a snowy December night, somewhere between the transition from cocoa to wine, four work-weary post-docs lay flung across the couches and floor. They were grumbling to each other about the weather and their thesis deadlines. Yuna Nishimori lay stretched out on a rug by the hearth, running through the details of her last failed experiment. After weeks of preparation, a wayward atom had interrupted her forty third attempt at conjuring a new protein, one she hoped would be able to self-modify as needed in order to halt the growth of cancer cells.
</p>
<p>“Every. Fucking. Time.” Yuna whined, running her thumbs over the tips of her fingers.
</p>
<p>At the time, microscopic conjurings had to been done in the dark at the edge of deep space with the aid of a team of wizards casting enhanced breath, pressure, warmth, perception, and teleportation spells. The micro-conjurer had seconds for each attempt as a small portion of their finger tips were carefully left exposed to the void. There is a high risk of warping prints if they are left exposed too long. But that is the risk many Real Micro researchers and micro-conjurers took in order to achieve the absolutely unimpeded line of effect required by such high-precision spellcraft.
</p>
<p>This is how it used to be. Before Abyssal Magic was developed, there was no way to alter the pull of magic, making these manipulations impossible to conduct in conventional earth-bound vacuum chambers or even near space regions. Despite working at the edge of deep space, the pull left Yuna with a great challenge before her.
</p>
<p>“How are your fingers doing, Yu?” asked Veerani Kommala, future CMO of Outer Spells, Inc.
</p>
<p>“Sore, but not damaged. Yet…” Yuna sighed, then rolled onto her stomach. “I for sure thought I had it this time. But then this photon bee-lined for the manipulation from, like, two hundred thousand miles away. I’ve got to get into deeper space.”
</p>
<p>Joshua Whent, the team’s teleportation caster, admonished, “You know we can’t, Cap. We’re already at our limits.”
</p>
<p>Yuna grimaced, but Joshua just yawned and tucked one arm under his head before administering his usual reassurance, “We’ll just run it again. You’re really close. You only have to get it once and then it can be sent off to the Geminizer lab.”
</p>
<p>“I know. I know you’re right. I just wish…I wish I could just get a stable vacuum for more than 3 seconds. Just push it all away.”
</p>
<p>This was the usual argument between the lab mates. But this time, Yuna’s comment gave me an idea.
</p>
<p>My eyes sprang open from a half-doze and I wondered aloud, “What if instead of pushing, you actually used the pull?”
</p>
<p><em><br></em>
</p>
<p><em>Ask and Ye Shall Receive</em>
</p>
<p>Over the eons, many theories have been posited by great wizards regarding the relationship between the pull of magic and void. Perhaps the most well-known explanation comes from the seventeenth century Grand Mage of Time and Space, Sevral Harnish:
</p>
<p><em><br></em>
</p>
<p><em>To cast is not to cast out, but to draw in. There is no power in absence, only in being; so the being is drawn to the power and thus in light and in life and in presence do we cast.</em>
</p>
<p><em><br></em>
</p>
<p>The idea that magic cannot occur in a vacuum persisted for generations without question. Splayed on a couch in the middle of Oklahoma, I stared at the ceiling for a long moment and a question stared back.
</p>
<p>With the development of the Abyssal Sphere technique to manipulate the pull of magic on Earth, Yuna was able to finally complete her thesis project, so that this year marks one hundred and fifty years since the Nishimori-Gomez protein ended the war against cancer and aging. Millions have benefitted from this most assuredly important work while the underlying magic has remained in the hands of Grand Mages and researchers.
</p>
<p>Today the power of the Abyssal Sphere technique can be yours to harness and command. The approach that brought new branches of magic and great discoveries into being is now available for your edification. While this is not a step-by- step guide, my hope is that through careful study, reflection, and practice, you too can discover the beauty and tranquility of the Abyss.
</p>
<p><em><br></em>
</p>
<p><em>Finding your Personal Abyss</em>
</p>
<p>Media portrayals of Abyssal Magic tend to focus on its application rather that its process. Everyone has seen ads featuring famous wizards who form glowing orbs around small objects to infuse them with some useful magical property. The teakettle smiles as the orb deconstitutes. Now it can tell you when your water is hot in pleasant, soothing tones! But infusion and micro-conjuring are only ends.
</p>
<p>The basic means lie in the Abyssal Sphere technique, a technique born of incredible concentration and stillness. It requires casters to understand themselves on infinitely diminishing and infinitely expanding scales. Through an intuitive knowledge of their own subatomic composition in relation to all other energy and matter, wizards can create an area of non-being inside a sphere of pure magical force. The difficulty lies in the creation of an extraordinarily strong magic sphere inside of which the pull of magic is perfectly uniform across the sphere’s interior surface. My friend and dean of the Anchorage College of the High Arts, Zora Modenov, once compared the forces in an abyssal sphere to the surface tension of a water droplet in space. The pull is taut and symmetrical if undisturbed by errant thought or emotion and in this space of mind, a space of reality is formed. If you can find this space for yourself, you can find your personal abyss. While this practice has brought me much in the way of magical discovery and worldly success, it has brought so much more to me by way of self-insight and inner calm. This is what I truly hope to share with you.
