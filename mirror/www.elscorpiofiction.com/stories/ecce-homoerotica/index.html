		<div id='text'><p><p>I carefully took Jesus's body down from the cross, and laid him gently on the cracked earth. I touched my fingers to the blood crusted around the wound in his side, then kissed him on his chapped blue lips. After a few minutes, he began to stirâ€”his eyelids fluttered, and I felt him reach up and tangle his hands in my hair. His body was warming under mine, his pallor fading into a burnished caramel.
</p>
<p>"Playing dead?" I whispered against his lips.
</p>
<p>"Pilate," he said.
</p>
<p>"So you still know me, Jesus of Nazareth."
</p>
<p>I ran my hand down the flat planes of his stomach. He caught my wrist and sat up, cupping my face with his other hand and pressing his lips back to mine. I ran my fingers through his ink-black beard as he pushed me to the ground and settled himself on top of me.
</p>
<p>"I'm gonna fill you with the Holy Spirit," he whispered in my ear.
</p>
<p>"I don't think so," I bit back. I rolled us over so he was on his back. Then I stood over him and took off my clothes, revealing my huge, throbbing erection.
</p>
<p>"Holy Father," Jesus said as he hungrily eyed my thick cock.
</p>
<p>"Got on your hands and knees," I said. He quickly complied, curling his hands into fists to keep the sand out of the sensitive wounds in his palms. I got down behind him and parted his cheeks. I heard him gasp with shock and pleasure as I began to run my tongue in circles around his opening. He moaned and bucked his hips as I spiraled closer and closer to the center, until I finally slipped my tongue inside the tight pink hole. He was delicious.
</p>
<p>"Pilate, please," whimpered Jesus.
</p>
<p>"Do you want my cock, King of the Jews?"
</p>
<p>"Thou sayest it," he gasped.
</p>
<p>Desperate with want, I rose to my knees and slowly slid inside him. The Son of Man needed no lubrication. His tight warmth enveloped me so completely that for a moment the rest of the world faded away, and it was just my hard, throbbing need and Jesus's slick, wanting asshole.
</p>
<p>"Oh my God," I groaned. I leaned forward and wrapped my arm around his waste. I snaked my other hand under him and briskly stroked his cock in time to my own thrusts. Below me, Jesus made inarticulate sounds of pleasure. He cried out as he came in my hand, and his insides gripped me like a vice. I pulled out of him with a shudder.
</p>
<p>"Suck on it," I commanded. Jesus eagerly took my erection into his mouth, seeming to enjoy his own taste as much as I had. I grabbed a handful of his obsidian locks as he suckled me greedily.
</p>
<p>"Jesus, I'm gonna come," I gasped, pulling out of his mouth and taking my cock in hand.
</p>
<p>"Oh God yes, baptize me."
</p>
<p>I gave myself a few quick strokes and came all over his face.
