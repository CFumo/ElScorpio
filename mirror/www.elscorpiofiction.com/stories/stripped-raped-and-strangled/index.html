		<div id='text'><p><p>“The toll of The Hatter’s hate-filled death lies too heavy on poor old Dormouse, my friend,” said Caterpillar.
</p>
<p>“On the Contrary, the one you call my friend,” answered the answer. “The Dormouse lies heavily on the appearance of the grief that was so hate-filled and final in the Mad Hatter’s first moments.”
</p>
<p>“You mean his last moments.”
</p>
<p>“The first moment of strangulation and suffering, of course,” the voice answered.
</p>
<p>“Furthermore,” Cheshire Cat curtly crept his sounds up an octave, “Dormouse was surely not happy with the annihilation of the Hatted one, but it WAS the day of Unhappiness, after all. It would have been uncouth for him to uncherish the glory of the day that he himself (with the Mad Hatter’s suggestion, of course) didn’t imbibe in the joy that was chosen to be the day of pure misery.”
</p>
<p>A puff of smoke escaped the round lips of Caterpillar, completely engulfing the place where The Cheshire Cat wasn’t. “So you speak of the joy of misery, or the misery of joy? I certainly; CERTAINLY see the former, but the latter is a puzzler.”
</p>
<p>The voice answered. “Think of this conundrum from the perspective of Dormouse. The Abuses and Injustices inflicted upon his mouse form amounted to nothing more than a few singed hairs and a ladle of tea poured into his snout. The joy of misery, therefore, is definitely a pervasive emotion. But!”
</p>
<p>The Cheshire Cat spoke with a candor unlike a trumpet of glory.
</p>
<p>“But the misery of joy, unbeknownst to Dormouse is precisely what makes up the majority of his tender feelings. You see, the one you call my friend, there is an uncontrollable urge for Dear Old Dormouse to feel an elevated elation over the defilement and dismemberment of the Mad Hatter.”
</p>
<p>“He WAS, mad after all,” Caterpillar slurred.
</p>
<p>“As are we all, of course.” The humor widened its rows upon rows of teeth. “The natural response to the feeling of a justified, but uncouth, sensation is to bounce back to the sorrow and self-loathing. Simple, really, if you know where to look inside of your friend.”
</p>
<p>“Inside?”
</p>
<p>“Indeed. One only has to see the seams ripping at the edges of Dormouse’s sanity to reflect on the pretty pink thoughts and fears. Fears of becoming the madness incarnate himself. Even now, I do see, Dormouse crawls on the Unbirthday table and is putting the smallest insects into pudding and hot tea. It is, after all, always tea time. Unless, after all, it is not.”
</p>
<p>“I follow this,” murmured Caterpillar. “I am inquisitive of the intentions of the newly intolerant mouse.”
</p>
<p>“You wish to speak to Dormouse himself?”
</p>
<p>“Certainly not! I won’t leave my comfortable home. I wish to experience the queer interaction through you.”
</p>
<p>Dormouse whispered secrets to the White Rabbit. <em>This is the last one. I promise. It will be the last, of course. Doubt clouded his empty eyes. Perhaps one LAST one after. I don’t wish to be a liar, but sometime the needs of the itching hands make me one. </em>
</p>
<p>“O Dormouse,” cackled the Cheshire Cat, “Do you wish to be introspective about the inquisitie intentions of your newly intolerant I?”
</p>
<p><em>Ah, the devil worm bears his sigil on the formless one. No, feline of negligence, I will NOT. Absolutely NOT. Unless… You have access and the ability to acquire an abducted effect of a personal nature. </em>
</p>
<p>“Only if it takes the time to acquire it, Dormouse. One can’t cease the effervescent flow of forward if there is no task to grasp onto it.”
</p>
<p><em>I want the hat. The hat of the loving HATED precious TRASH saint WHORE pious MONSTROUS Hatter. </em>
</p>
<p>The grin stretched beyond the light of the full day. “You seek the the leash of you master and abuser, or perhaps the love lace of the cherished cherub who we all know?”
</p>
<p><em>I need the hat. I need the hat. I need the hat. I need the hat. The strength, the confidence, the power comes from the hate. I swear it. I know it to be true despite what the white infinite liar of a rabbit whispers back to me. </em>
</p>
<p>The large hat sat on top of the maggot-filled unbirthday cake. “It seems like we have found it together, o Dormouse,” the thunderous cackle echoed from the trees ‘round the clearing.
</p>
<p><em>Ah yes. The dominion. Finally I can save HATE the saint KILLER who loved HURT me. No matter the little creatures. And no matter to you, you grin of a grin. You’ll see my intentions, that you will. Even the Queen will quake in her headless casket.  </em>
</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” the voice whispered, dripping the jealous joy of a watcher.
</p>
<p>As the Caterpillar and the White Rabbit watched on, Dormouse snatched the massive, green hat with a brusque swipe and utterly covered his torso with it.
</p>
<p><em>Oh yes. Oh yes. I feel the feel. Rabbit! I Command you to abuse the pitiful Dormouse</em>. And so they did. Despite his protests, Dormouse was repeatedly dunked into the ever-boiling tea. The screams were unbearable, and so was the laughter of the overlarge smile.
</p>
<p>“I think we two see the intentions firsthand, Caterpillar. Why lose the experiences of what life gives if when the small details are stroked away by blade and hand? Nothing is irreplaceable. Your home. It will regrow. The whisper of breath that may be floating by as we are speak will be there in another form in a blink of an eye. Abused Dormouse is not married to The Hatter. He seeks and finds what he wants. We will all fertilize the dirt in one way or another, but we will all do it eventually. Why not go out whilst doing what you have learned to love over the long years of harsh friendship?”
</p>
<p>“Huh…”
</p>
<p><em>I suffer, for I deserve it. I suffer, for I deserve it. I suffer, for I deserve it. I suffer, for I deserve it. I love HATE myself. I am worthLESS. I suffer. I deserve it.</em>
</p>
<p><em><br></em>
</p>
<p><em>Prompt, Samantha Valasek: "The cheshire cat and the caterpillar engage in philosophical conversation regarding the death of the madhatter and the dormouse's grief"</em>
