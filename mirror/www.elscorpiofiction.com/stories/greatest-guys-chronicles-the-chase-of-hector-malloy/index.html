		<div id='text'><p><p>Eyes filled with fury, Alice Sparrow gripped the leather steering wheel of her souped up Impala. The sweet smell of high-octane fuel wafted through the bullet holes in the windshield.
</p>
<p>AS: Motherfuckers are gonna pay for that.
</p>
<p>The V10 engine roared as Alice slammed the gas pedal to the floor. Her body pushed into the leather bucket seat. 230. 240. 250. The speedometer flew past those numbers and beyond. The car careened down Topanga Canyon with the professional driver easily avoiding the pedestrians and traffic. The car phone rang. Alice picked up.
</p>
<p>AS: What’s up, sensei?
</p>
<p>A wizened voice answered. It was Master Cosmo Fumo.
</p>
<p>CF: Pupil, if a mad dog catches a hungry wolf, has it truly won?
</p>
<p>Alice tensed and was about to raise her voice, but the wisdom of Cosmo’s words dawned on her. The driver eased off the gas pedal. The monstrous roar of the 1 ton engine quieted, as if disappointed.
</p>
<p>AS: Of course, sensei. I have been a fool.
</p>
<p>CF: Pupil, is a pack of dogs stronger than the individual dogs?
</p>
<p>The wisdom of Cosmo’s words dawned on Alice again. She couldn’t take down Malloy by herself, for Malloy was the wolf- hungry for crime. Alice was but a dog. Good with protecting the household of humanity, but not a match against the hunger for crime. No. This job called for the Whole Pack. The driver stepped back onto the gas pedal. Flames shot out of the engine so far that the light pole next to which Alice drove caught fire. It was a really good car.
</p>
<p>AS: Of course, sensei. I have been a fool. I’ll call the others at once.
</p>
<p>CF: Very good.
</p>
<p>Alice slammed the phone into its cradle and picked it up again. She dialed the phone number of Graham Lipsman. Alicee dodged traffic as she drifted onto Ventura Boulevard. The phone rang once. Twice. Before the end of the third ring, a honeyed voice answered.
</p>
<p>GL: Is Malloy on the move?
</p>
<p>AS: Yes.
</p>
<p>The door leading to the limo section of the Impala opened. Graham walked through, putting on his signature sport coat and sat down in the passenger seat. Alice smiled coolly to herself and slammed down the phone into its cradle.
</p>
<p>AS: Good to see you at the helm, Graham.
</p>
<p>GL: It’s good to be back.
</p>
<p>AS: How was the news interview back there?
</p>
<p>GL: Shannon Doyle was a bitch, as usual. Asked about the Red Forest Incident.
</p>
<p>AS: That bitch. I would have punched her.
</p>
<p>Graham laughed. A typical faux pas for Alice- something that Graham would never have done. It was to be expected. Graham was, after all, the face of the organization. Let strengths be strengths. HE certainly couldn’t drive really well from anywhere to anywhere like Alice could.
</p>
<p>GL: Alice, my friend, if only it was so easy. I brought out a good bottle of wine and poured her a glass. After a few drinks and a hand massage, Shannon forgot all about her question. The conversation turned to other things and that was that.
</p>
<p>Alice's brow furrowed. She wasn’t any good at this stuff. Her hand moved swiftly to the transmission and the whine of the gearbox dropped an octave.
</p>
<p>AS: Gee, Graham. I’m not any good at this stuff. Will I ever learn?
</p>
<p>GL: In due time. You’re still coming to dressage party tomorrow?
</p>
<p>AS: Of course.
</p>
<p>GL: Excellent. The first step in being a gentleman is to learn how to act well around horses.
</p>
<p>Alice nodded. Today turned out to be filled with wise words. The two rode west, toward the setting sun. The phone rang and Graham picked up. The Guys were uniting again.
