		<div id='text'><p><p>Dr. Peter Hensley felt his way through a messy hallway and into what appeared to be the office of the renowned psychic medium Madame Cooke. An old, ornate light fixture cast a yellow glow over the dining table in the center of the room. A small fraction of the light reached beyond the table and illuminated the horde of peculiar trinkets and books with vaguely occult themes that cluttered the walls. Thick curtains concealed what Dr. Hensley presumed was once a window, though he found it hard to imagine sunlight ever having entered this room. Madame Cooke—looking younger than Dr. Hensley had envisioned—wore an ensemble of embroidered scarves and shawls that seemed decidedly stereotypical for her profession. She was already seated at the table and, with a warm smile, beckoned the doctor to follow suit.
</p>
<p>“Good evening Mr. Hensley. Please make yourself comfortable. I would be delighted to indulge your curiosity, but honestly I don’t expect that you will believe me.”
</p>
<p>“Respectfully, Madam, I don’t expect to believe anything you say,” Hensley quipped. He looked around the room as he took a seat, feeling mildly claustrophobic.
</p>
<p>“Why don’t we start with what you think I do?” said the medium, her voice brimming with light hearted sarcasm. Dr. Hensley frowned at her but decided to play along.
</p>
<p>“People who believe in this kind of stuff consider you the most credible psychic in town. Supposedly you’ve even had some high profile clients from other countries.”
</p>
<p>Madame Cooke crossed her arms and nodded reticently.
</p>
<p>“You practice psychometry, which I believe means that you can infer personal information about people, living or otherwise, through physical contact with their possessions. Some people even say that you can directly commune with the dead through these possessions.”
</p>
<p>“Close enough,” she muttered, gazing at the table and concentrating on the doctor’s voice.
</p>
<p>“What I don’t understand,” Hensley continued, “is how an inert piece of matter could apparently retain such abstract information.”
</p>
<p>Madame Cooke nodded and sat quietly for a moment.
</p>
<p>“Are you familiar with the concept of Ley lines, Doctor?”
</p>
<p>“Sure, but…”
</p>
<p>“What if I told you that Ley lines do exist; not as a manifestation of some kind of paranormal energy, but as an intersection of higher dimensional spaces?”
</p>
<p>“What…” Dr. Hensley’s eyes widened in surprise.
</p>
<p>“Did you bring a personal item like I requested?”
</p>
<p>“Yes, I… here.”
</p>
<p>The doctor fumbled in his satchel and produced a small wooden figure. He handed it to the medium hurriedly, wanting her to continue her explanation.
</p>
<p>“To be clear, doctor, I believe it is impossible to communicate with the dead. However, in my experience it is not impossible to communicate with an entity that transcends our three dimensional world. One that, perhaps, could see into your past and future as easily as you can see the contents of this room.”
</p>
<p>“Are you telling me that you communicate with extradimensional time traveling aliens?” Dr. Hensley’s skepticism was palpable.
</p>
<p>“Oh no, not aliens…” said Madame Cooke, trailing off. Her attention was now focused on the wooden figure. She held it firmly in her hands and began to rock back and forth, whispering to herself.
</p>
<p>Dr. Hensley waited as patiently as he could while Madame Cooke made her performance. His attention had just begun to wander when he was startled by a cold chill running down his spine. He began to feel a sort of… presence, as if there was something lurking in the shadows of the room. He looked around but saw nothing. He heard nothing other than Madame Cooke’s strange incantation. “Whatever it is, it’s not real,” he thought. Then, as if responding to his assertion, a book levitated off of its dusty shelf and floated into the light near the table.
</p>
<p>“Dear god,” Hensley whispered, shrinking into his chair. Madame Cooke finally finished her invocation and looked up.
</p>
<p>“I found one,” she said, smiling. “He’s here with us. Don’t be afraid though, it’s not what you think.”
</p>
<p>“Then what the hell is it?”
</p>
<p>The book opened and began flipping its pages rapidly.
</p>
<p>“Well… Two hundred years from now somebody will invent a kind of engine that can send huge spacecraft across the galaxy in minutes. The engine works by moving the ship through another dimension they call ‘pseudospace’, where distances are much shorter.”
</p>
<p>Dr. Hensley continued to stare at the book.
</p>
<p>“Sometimes these engines become unstable and break down, leaving travelers stranded in pseudospace. For some reason, once they’re there, they’re stuck.”
</p>
<p>“Is this being caused by one of those travelers?” the doctor asked, motioning toward the book.
</p>
<p>“Yes. They say my house is located in a ‘pinch’; A location in three dimensional space that is physically overlapping a part of pseudospace. It makes it possible for them to find me and we can interact to a limited degree.”
</p>
<p>The book dropped to the floor. Dr. Hensley continued staring at it for another minute before coming to his senses.
</p>
<p>“They… but why do they care to interact with you at all?”
</p>
<p>“Lonely I guess? I don’t really know. But once we make contact, I make a deal with them. They must tell me some information about my clients’ past and future, and in return I will make arrangements for them to never actually start their disastrous pseudojump.”
</p>
<p>“You mean… in the future?”
</p>
<p>“Yes. I know how strange this must sound.”
</p>
<p>The doctor rubbed his face and glanced back at the book, which was now making its way back to its shelf.
</p>
<p>“Okay, presuming that I believe all of this, what purpose does the personal item serve?”
</p>
<p>Madame Cooke smiled warmly and tossed Dr. Hensley his wooden figure.
</p>
<p>“People thought I was a fraud until I added a prop.”
