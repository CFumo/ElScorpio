		<div id='text'><p><p>Society lay in ruin. Obamacare had the side effect of destroying capitalism in the only country where it had survived the 20th century. Thanks, Obama. A hipster sat on the sidewalk with a sign that read, "Probably need $$$? Giving to the Homeless: Interesting Fulfilling Experience. Participate in Incentivizing Homelessness." Rachel, in a trenchcoat and trilby, paused before him and made a vertical wave and two straight lines down through with her index and middle fingers, symbolizing the dollar sign. He likewise. She rushed on, the trenchcoat threatening to reveal her everything to all passersby.
</p>
<p>Entering the empty, dim and defunct Taggart Station one could barely make out the statue of beheaded Nat Taggart. Carefully instructed on the route, Rachel knew her way to the offices of the decrepit skyscraper. Though she was surprised to learn the area had been cleared of the nihilists that congregated on the crypt of capitalism. Amused she wondered if they had been killed for her arrival, their outlook thus completely justified. That was, after all, Dagny's main ambition these days. The grand new and free society can of course not share any space with those who could endanger the founding principles.
</p>
<p>Rachel hoped Dagny was waiting for her. She yearned for her iron grip, her unyielding will to use anything, anyone for her own primal pleasure. And she had chosen Rachel. In some ways Rachel had chosen Dagny. She had made herself present at the Taggart harem in Galt's Gulch, charming Dagny with her knowledge of proper conduct between business partners, the prime importance of private enterprise and how the rights of corporations extend even to eclipse basic human rights. Lead in the water, methane clouds overhead? How the folk can yap.
</p>
<p>"Dagny," Rachel whispered under her breath. She hoped she had waited for her. She knew the chance was slim to none. Dagny was a busy and ambitious woman. The only person in the world capable of creating a new and glorious Empire. But she hoped, while she climbed the staircase, lit by red Exit signs. She was out of breath at the top floor, but on time. "Taggart Transcontinental Executive Offices" read the plaque by the door. She entered.
</p>
<p>She had not even had time to adjust to the brightness when she heard Dagny's voice: "Rachel, take off your coat," she demanded over the intercom. Rachel did as she was told, knees already quivering with anticipation. The trenchcoat fell in a heap, revealing her perfect bosom. Her nipples could cut glass. Her hot tight pussy could mold it into an avant-garde sculpture. Dagny stood up from the executive chair behind the executive desk in the executive office. She leaned on the doorframe, lit cigarette in hand, and said, "Hi," simply. "Hi," Rachel mustered, blushing. "Come into my office. I want to show you something," Dagny said, slowly unbuttoning her executive blouse.
</p>
<p>The two women stood at the window, gazing at the corpse of New York City. "I need someone I can trust. A person who will expertly guide the world to new heights. Someone who will do ... anything I ask. Because they know what's best for them. Are you loyal to me?" "Always, my love," Rachel locked eyes with Dagny. Dagny almost smiled, before she caught herself. "Good. Take these, you begin immediately," she said handing her a stack of business cards.
</p>
<p>Rachel Older
</p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer
</p>
<p>Taggart International
</p>
<p>725 Fifth Avenue · (212) 832-2000<br>
</p>
<p>"Now, show me your passion, Rachel. Pleasure me like only you know how," Dagny commanded with deep hunger. Rachel pushed her into the executive chair and straddled. She grinded on Dagny's crotch and threw the trilby across the room. Leaning in, Rachel let Dagny nibble on her nipples while she used her hand to zip her skirt down. She pulled it off expertly, delicately. "Green?" Rachel asked. "The color of money. I thought you would like the symbolism," Dagny explained, continuing, "and look," showing off her backside: A white dollar sign on each cheek. "Oh, that's gauche!" Rachel exclaimed with a slap on Dagny's chiseled derrière. "I thought you'd like it," she demurred. "I love it! Now take it off."
</p>
<p>Dagny laid arched prone as a Romanesque statue on the cleared executive desk. Rachel greedily lapped her bare cleft from behind, meanwhile giving her pretty pink asshole the attention it deserved. Rachel climbed on top of the executive desk and laid down, embracing Dagny, slowly their breasts roving softly. They sat back, their right legs over each others' left, and with deep loving gazes began tribbing until they came together.
</p>
<p>Their moans would echo across the Taggart building for the remainder of the evening. They orgasmed multiple times in unison and then created a global ultra-capitalist society that stood the test of time and made everyone who survived it optimally satisfied on their own terms forever.
