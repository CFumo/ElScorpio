		<div id='text'><p><p>It was after Eleanor's third relationship ended that her heart started to turn black. The others had left callouses, but those had been chiseled away with a declaration of loyalty and a little charm. The third carved a hole in her heart and when it healed over, it had the color and texture of coal.
</p>
<p>A string of casual dates and a one night stand that lasted a few nights too long only expedited the process. Eleanor, meanwhile, was having the time of her life. Men showered her with attention. She felt adored and important, without having to give anything in return.
</p>
<p>Eleanor's first murder was completely by accident. She was engaged in an intense make out session when, not realizing her heart's hunger, she breathed in too deeply and sucked out her suitor's soul. She was filled with a rush of excitement and wonder. And power. If you were listening carefully, you'd know that was when her heart stopped beating.
</p>
<p>Eleanor learned to be more careful, monitoring the men's heart rates before it got too deadly. Occasionally, she would indulge. The doctors wrote these casualties off as unknown aneurysms, in part to hide their own confusion.
</p>
<p>The men who survived were left feeling hopeless and empty. They assumed they were in love with Eleanor and their depression was caused by her abandonment. Meanwhile, Eleanor was beginning to be unhappy. Soul-sucking was her drug habit. She did it more to sustain complacency than to feel alive. Her own soul longed to love, a feeling she had long forgotten.
</p>
<p>At night, the voices of the fallen would haunt her.
</p>
<p>"You sneaky whore!" they'd scream. "Tricking us with your beauty and charm!  All we wanted was to love you!"
</p>
<p>She had tried to reason with them, but now they were met with a cold indifference.
</p>
<p>Bingeing on a bachelor party is what did it. An idea had been stewing in Eleanorâ€™s mind for awhile, but the barbarism made her cringe at the thought. Plus, she wasn't sure it would work. But when she was surrounded by 8 lifeless bodies, high on adrenaline and their lust, she finally had the audacity to carry out her plan. Eleanor grabbed a man's pocket knife then carved out the groom's heart to replace her own. The surgery was an overwhelming success. She could love again.
</p>
<p>It was after four serious lovers and a broken off engagement that Eleanor's new heart started to turn black. But this time she knew what to do.
