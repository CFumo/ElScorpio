		<div id='text'><p><p>Dear Santa
</p>
<p>All I want for Christmas is a shit load of teeth! (I hope 'shit' is ok to use. I assume so. I bet you’re not an old-timey moralist. Those guys were diiiicks)
</p>
<p>Anyway, I don’t want anything else. No new xbox, no tickets to Hawaii (as if!), no... socks! Please save whatever currency you convert my 'nice-ness' to and get me a bulk amount of bargain-priced human teeth.
</p>
<p>Dude, I don't want dog teeth. I want straight up human teeth. No particular reason, either. I suppose I have an inkling to make an art thing out of them or something, but knowing my started project:finished project ratio... well, you know how it goes.
</p>
<p>Straight up buckets of teeth. Enough to fill a bathtub!
</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, I'm not really sure how much goodness I've been creating this year, so I'm not gonna be grouchy if I don't get a literal BATHTUB full of 'em. I wouldn't balk at a big jar of them.
</p>
<p>Uhhh, I dunno if I have to list all the good things I did. Seems like you're a teleporting humanoid thing that, if real, has no concern for time and space. I bet you know my sins and virtues, so whatever. I hope slamming some mad sativa rippers and cold-messaging you isn't a deal-breaker. And, I guess, misusing stoner terms? I don't know if you're really into that green stuff.
</p>
<p>-Zhenya
</p>
<p>P.S. Sending a little 'goodie bag' to grease your wheels, you red Rasta giant, you!
</p>

<p>A few days ago I sent the above letter to 96930 Arctic Circle, etc etc. It was a Friday after a long week's worth of work and, yeah, I was pretty stony. And yeah, sending pot candy to Finland is probably a Very Bad Idea™ (not to mention the (quick) drive to the post office and a colorful conversation with my new friend, Ted the Mailman).
</p>
<p>But, you know, I didn't even remember doing what I did. So, you can imagine my great surprise when a PALLET full of small-to-medium boxes loomed, like a monolith of shame, over my front door.
</p>
<p>mery christmrnt 1/365
</p>
<p>That was written on the shipping manifest attached to the tower.
</p>
<p>By this time, the green fog lifted from my memory and I allowed my mind to run amok with wonder and joy. Santa is real! Magic is real! Holy shit, this may be a controlled delivery of ANYTHING illegal to help send me to federal jail for SENDING DRUGS TO FINLAND OH FUCK.
</p>
<p>But, on second, thought, why would they send me so many boxes?
</p>
<p>My fear turned back to joy turned to horror after I slit open one of the boxes from the top of the pile.
</p>
<p>Teeth. Filled to the cardboard brim with teeth. The worst part was the type of teeth- it was all over the place. Tiny child teeth, worn, cavitied ones, teeth fragments, etc. Some even had foul-smelling flesh attached.
</p>
<p>Where the fuck did the teeth come from?
</p>
<p>Well, from Santa, I guess. That wasn't... I suppose that's a given. I was terrified by where Santa SOURCED the teeth from. Grave digging? God, I hope it was grave digging. I mean, I would prefer them to have come from ethical sources like... dentist schools? Is there a big pile of teeth they dump into? So many questions.
</p>
<p>I spent an hour lugging all the boxes to my basement right away, lest anyone saw 500 pounds of human product in the entryway.
</p>
<p>Oh you know what I forgot? The message. 1/365? Did that mean what I hoped it didn't mean?
</p>
<p>Yeah, it did. The next day another set of boxes came through. It was larger than the last, but not by much.
</p>
<p>Over the course of the week, my basement was filled with boxes. See, I thought they were all teeth, which would have been terrible in the first place, but I actually went through one shipment thoroughly. There was a kilo of what appeared to be cocaine.
</p>
<p>gud shit ;) 100% f i s h s c a l e
</p>
<p>Was written on the side of THAT particular gem. I could no longer report any of this to anyone official. Santa Claus was sending me 20K worth of drugs every DAY.
</p>
<p>Oh, and the teeth. The teeth! I searched news sites for tooth-related keywords.
</p>
<p>Yeah, it wasn't good. Countless stories from overseas mentioned incidents in rural villages in poor countries. Whole populations underwent minor blunt-force facial trauma and were missing their teeth. Thousands of bodies were exhumed from graveyards across the globe and beheaded. I knew where the teeth were going, BUT WHERE WERE THE HEADS!?
</p>
<p>I'm a month into this horror. I've been sending Santa letters begging for him to stop, but all I get back is Return To Sender mail inexplicably filled with eggnog coupons.
</p>
<p>Many of my friends, acquaintances, and strangers on the street have been getting tooth necklaces, so I guess it's not all bad?
</p>
<p>Last night I got a special Express delivery. It was a bespoke wooden box with a note written on crumbling parchment:
</p>
<p>bonus toth:elf enojoy !
</p>
<p>Below, a certificate of authenticity and ownership, along with a small description fit for inclusion in a fantasy novel. Within a glass tessaract, atop a wisp of cloud lay a 6-inch serrated, wicked object. Less a tooth and more a kris. Inordinately heavy; it gave off an aura of hate.
</p>
<p>I am afraid of this monster, this mythical Santa. I regret my arrogance and hope to never encounter an elf. My life is ruined and I don't know what the fuck is going on.
