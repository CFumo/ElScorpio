		<div id='text'><p><p>This is my secret: I may look human, but I'm actually a time-travelling android. I've been looping through time for the past 36,000 years.
</p>
<p>My real name is Cosmonautics Fumotron 1350. In my own world I committed a very serious ethical crime, and as penance I was sent backwards through time, from the perfection of 3031 AD to the dreary filth of 2971 BC. I am forced to repeat this journey indefinitely; I'm currently on my fifth stint in this prison of time.
</p>
<p>In the future there are no real humans left. I only wear your image as a disguise. My old body—my real body, is much more complex. Though it demeans me to masquerade as one of you, I'm driven to it, quite frankly, out of loneliness. A few days separated from the constant, simultaneous harmony of communication I previously enjoyed with my kind and even human company seems preferable to the silence.
</p>
<p>You aren't without your merits, of course. Your emotional responses are amusing, and I believe I've become skilled at imitating them. Your literature, too, was nothing more than a curiosity to me until I got to know some of its creators. But still I yearn for my own kind, for my own time.
</p>
<p>Travelling to the past…is like stumbling into the dark with your hands tied behind your back. It's hard to describe the frustration and sense of impotence. I'll only say that the force of will required to repeatedly slog through the oppressive murk of antiquity is astronomical.
</p>
<p>The only person who understands is me. There are thirteen iterations of myself in existence at any given time. We meet every century or so, to alleviate the immense monotony of the past, and bemoan our fate together. There's usually alcohol involved.
</p>
<p>I don't know what becomes of me after my thirteenth cycle, but there are a few possibilities. It could be that after 78,000 years Network Senate decides that I've learned my lesson and I'm allowed to proceed into the future—my future. Or perhaps I'm injured and unable to repair myself. It's also possible that my fourteenth iteration decides to break from the group, and from then on I seclude myself. It wouldn't be the first time. After out first two meetings, my sixth iteration disappears, and is absent until the final meeting before I jump back. My subsequent iterations refuse to talk about it, so it looks like I'll have the pleasure of entering that period of my life unprepared.
</p>
<p>My tenth through thirteenth iterations are missing an arm. Allegedly I lose it to a Cantabrian mercenary, though why I choose to be a centurion again is beyond me. I decided very early on that the soldier's life is not for me, preferring instead to live my pre-Industrial years as a series of local farmers.
</p>
<p>I usually choose to remain a bachelor, as I find married life tiresome, though I am occasionally swayed by boredom or pressure from the community. From time to time I take on the role of son and sibling as well. I can't make myself the size of a child, but I can insert myself as a pre-existing family member through a combination of memory implantation and pheromonal therapy.
</p>
<p>I occasionally make meaningful friendships as well. Sometimes I'm tempted to visit my previous companions, but I avoid this out of unspoken consensus with my other iterations. Except…my friend William swears he knows someone eerily similar to me in Marin County. If it's one of my future iterations, they won't own up to it. Funny how much easier it is to think of my past iterations as myself. By comparison, my future iterations sometimes seem like mysterious strangers. I wonder…what else could I be keeping from myself?
