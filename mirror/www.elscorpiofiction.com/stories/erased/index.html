		<div id='text'><p><p>My son was a charming person, seventeen, brown curly hair and inquisitive eyes. I loved the little star birthmark he had behind his left ear, or was it his right?  He would shrug his shoulders back when he’d get nervous, like my husband Henry used to do.
</p>
<p>I loved him. I think I did. I feel like I should have. It’s getting so hard to remember…it’s only been a few days, feels like years. I remember the feeling though. I remember what that pain was. But it’s fading, just like his memory.
</p>
<p>He was my boy, he didn’t even do anything wrong. I don’t think he did.  Just got involved with the wrong people, I guess that's what everyone says, that was the story of James Anderson's boy too, Michael.  But they didn't do with him what they did to my boy, because his name I still remember.  I don't even know who lead them to find the record.  That's why I think there's more to this than we know, and will ever know.
</p>
<p>My son was a young man, a kind young man; fourteen or so? I'm not sure...Oh, seventeen, I said that earlier.  That's what this is for I guess. And I guess I can't say if he was kind for sure now, everything's all muddled...but I believe that he was, my heart tells me that it's true. My child must have done something to offend the bad people. That's what everyone tells me.
</p>
<p>I was there when they did it, I saw them erase his name in front of me. It was one of the most painful things I've ever witnessed.  I don't remember what my child's name was. I hardly remember what they looked like, what they called me, their age.  But I will never forget the way the man in the dark suit and red tie smirked slightly as he slowly and thoroughly erased my child from existence.
</p>
<p>Yes, the name was gone, but so was the way she parted her hair, and how she'd look at us defiantly when we scolded her.  My husband Henry loved having a child.  She was his angel. I'm trying to write everything down so I don't lose her completely. I feel crazy. I feel like I'm making this up.  Maybe I never had a child. The feeling could just be in my head.  But I feel like it's true. Probably because everywhere I go I see the eraser shavings that wiped my child off the face of this earth.
