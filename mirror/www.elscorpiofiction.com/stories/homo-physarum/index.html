		<div id='text'><p><p>A small U.N. command vessel cartwheeled through space toward the binary system EL-197D. Onboard, a crowd of linguists, biologists, mathematicians, and historians had gathered in a cramped briefing room; enjoying the comfortable 0.7g produced by the centrifugal forces of the ship’s artificial-gravity maneuver. The din of academic conversation echoed noisily through the metal halls of the ship. Pocketing his notes, First Officer Joe Harrison stepped nervously in front of the crowd and tapped the microphone on his lapel. There was a thump from the speakers and the whine of slight feedback as the crowd’s murmuring waned.
</p>
<p>“Good m-morning everyone. I know you’ve all been preparing for tomorrow’s events for months or sometimes… err… in some cases years, and I know you’ve all read the information we’ve prepared for you, but I wanted to take a moment to explain this situation in a less, uh, clinical fashion. From the perspective of a soldier, I guess.”
</p>
<p>Harrison took a moment to catch his breath and calm his nerves. He didn’t enjoy public speaking and he found that addressing such accomplished academics was considerably worse than speaking to soldiers under his command. His hands were shaking, so he kept them clasped behind his back.
</p>
<p>“Humanity doesn’t really have the best reputation among the alien species we have thus far foug- …uhh… encountered. As you probably know, this is mostly due to, um, our capacity for individuality, which we’ve come to learn is a trait that rarely survives a species’ entry into the space age. Or… well, to put it differently, most species that don’t have a hive-mind or meta-consciousness of some sort by the time they start attempting deep space travel tend to basically exterminate themselves. We guys… or… humans are a lucky exception to that rule.”
</p>
<p>He tried to sneak a look at his notes but they had rotated in his breast pocket and wouldn’t come out. After a few seconds of pulling awkwardly at his uniform and trying to ignore the oppressive silence in front of him Joe realized he’d have to deliver the rest of his speech from memory. He unruffled his uniform and continued.
</p>
<p>“So… More importantly, since most species seem to discover superluminal travel a bit later in their technological timeline, they tend to have already radically optic…uh… optimized their own physiologies. In other words they rapidly evolve to be very clean and fragile. By galactic standards, we humans are very primitive and slimy and … generally disgusting.”
</p>
<p>This last comment elicited some laughter from the audience, which put Officer Harrison a bit more at ease. He noticed that he had been nervously touching his nose and put his hands awkwardly on his hips.
</p>
<p>“Seriously though, it’s like a culture-shock problem. Uhh… We don’t just gross them out, we scare them. Most of them anyway. For example; most living species—on Earth or otherwise— can’t really survive the loss of a limb whether or not they get immediate medical treatment. But humans! Humans can uh… lose three limbs, maybe take a bullet to the head, light on fire… and still live to tell the story. Compared to most of our extraterrestrial neighbors, we’re just these crazy unkillable monsters. We’re basically cockroaches.”
</p>
<p>Joe rubbed his nose. Some of the people in the crowd had frowned at that last part. He made a mental note to avoid calling smart people cockroaches and to try to avoid talking about combat. He took another deep breath and did his best to stop shaking. It worked for two or three seconds.
</p>
<p>“The slime thing is a real problem too. We secrete a bunch of incredibly odorous oils and waste products and we digest food with really, uh… extremely toxic saliva. Most of the alien species we’ve encountered can trace their evolv… err… evolutionary history to a point where they were like us but they eventually eradicate disease and switch over to intravenous food sources. Our very presence is seen as like a huge biohazard onboard their ships.”
</p>
<p>The captain was standing in the back of the crowd, pointing at his watch and looking annoyed. <em>How long had he been there?</em> Officer Harrison couldn’t remember the ending of his speech. He felt a droip of sweat slide down his back. He did his best to finish quickly.
</p>
<p>“So, basically, uhh… we d-don’t know what the creatures of EL-197D will be like but they’re p-probably going to see us as monsters. They probably don’t understand concepts like uh… disagreement so… yeah. Uh… Just be nice? And good luck. Thanks… er… Thank you. That’s it.”
</p>
<p>Officer Harrison flipped off his microphone, wiped a pool of sweat from his brow, and walked quickly out of the room.
