		<div id='text'><p><p>Anya could tell through her blindfold that the sun was starting to set. It was her favorite time of day. She took a big gulp of the saliva that had pooled in her mouth from the gag. Her hands were bound behind her back, but her feet remained free. For now.
</p>
<p>The metallic clink of her captor’s footsteps sent a shiver down Anya’s spine. What would he do to her this time?
</p>
<p>“Oh little Anya. What do we have here?”
</p>
<p>The voice rang in her ear as a cold, metal finger caressed her thigh. It ran along the inner length of her leg, venturing higher each time. Anya could hear her breaths shallow.
</p>
<p>“You've been good,” GRAHAM allowed. “I think we can take this off.” The gag loosened and Anya could feel it fall to her lap. “Get on your knees!” the voice bellowed.
</p>
<p>Quickly, Anya slid off her chair to the ground. GRAHAM reached around her and carefully untied the thin silk strings that held Anya’s clothing intact. He brushed the thin silk away and lightly glanced over her nipples with the hard edge of his fingertips. “Tell me,” he whispered, “how much you want it.”
</p>
<p>“Please,” Anya pleaded. Her body was overwhelmed with anticipation and desire. Her eyes were rolling in the back of her head with each passing glance of his fingers.
</p>
<p>“Beg!” GRAHAM commanded.
</p>
<p>---
</p>
<p>This faux-prisoner play was the only way Anya could feel passably comfortable having sex with a robot. It had taken much convincing on his part that he wasn't a sex toy of her making. Though, admittedly, Anya had made adjustments to his hardware after they started their charade. When he was in control, she didn't feel like she was using him. It felt more consensual.
</p>
<p>---
</p>
<p>“Ask me.” GRAHAM directed.
</p>
<p>Anya could feel the familiar tingle building. “Can I,” she gasped, “can I please…”
</p>
<p>She moaned loudly, unable to finish her sentence.
</p>
<p>“You used to be louder,” a playful voice cooed in Anya’s ear.
</p>
<p>Her eyes opened with a start. This voice had been accompanied by a breath of air.
</p>
<p>“Graham!” Anya shouted. She tried to reach for her blindfold, but Graham’s strong arms pinned her down.
</p>
<p>“Ah ah ah,” he chuckled. “You know that's not allowed.” His soft, warm lips pressed against her own. Anya's mouth parted to breathe him in.
</p>
<p>She struggled to pull away. “But you-” you’re supposed to be dead, she wanted to finish.
</p>
<p>“Shh.” Graham lightly stopped her protest with his hand. “I'll tell you later. Just enjoy yourself for now.”
</p>
<p>On cue, Anya’s back arched as she cried out. GRAHAM had never stopped working.
</p>
<p>Graham kissed her gently, then left a trail of kisses down her body, spending extra time on each breast. Anya groped for his head, guiding it back up her body. She pulled him close to her, pressing his body against her own. She could feel him, bulging against her thigh. Anya ran her hands up and down his back before lifting up his shirt to remove it. She reached for his belt buckle and fumbled to undo it.
</p>
<p>“I- I can see anything,” she giggled sheepishly. Graham kissed her forehead.
</p>
<p>“I guess we can fix that.” He pulled off her blindfold
</p>
<p>Anya’s breath caught as she looked at him. He had lived so long in her imagination and now here he was, again. Alive. Anya didn't realize she was crying until her tears dripped onto her collarbone.
</p>
<p>“No,” Graham mumbled gruffly, “you don't get to be sad right now.” His head dipped below her waist and she felt his warm tongue caress her. Anya gripped his head, paralyzed with pleasure. Her sadness evaporated. He always knew how to distract her.
</p>
<p>With each flick of his tongue she felt a new wave of ecstasy. “How much do you want it right now,” Graham growled.
</p>
<p>“So much,” Anya said weakly. “Please. Make love to me.” Graham wriggled out of his pants. Anya quickly sprung up and took him in her mouth.
</p>
<p>“Ahhh,” Graham sighed. Anya felt his body twist. “Won't you join us?” his voice called.
</p>
<p>Anya heard the creaking of GRAHAM moving closer. She looked up at Graham in surprise. He wore a mischievous grin. Anya felt the cold fingers vibrating between her legs. She groaned, Graham still full in her mouth. She heard him chuckle above her. “Well, this should be fun.”
