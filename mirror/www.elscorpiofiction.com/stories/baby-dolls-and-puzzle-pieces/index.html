		<div id='text'><p><p>Sofie stared openly at her grandmother. She wondered at her strangeness. What was Grandma doing? Why was she stealing Sofie's baby dolls? Other adults didn't take her toys. Even her cousins would ask and share and always gave them back if she asked. But Grandma kept them. She hid them in her room: under pillows, in drawers, between furniture.
</p>
<p>Sometimes Sofie spied on her grandmother, peaking from the doorway, trying to stay unseen. She would see wrinkled hands pat the dolls' hair and smooth their dresses. Sometimes her grandmother smiled and cooed over the dolls, but often she just held them close to her chest, not doing much at all.
</p>
<p>Today Grandma was in a good mood and wanted to talk and hug, but Sofie stood on the other side of the room, far away and quiet. She didn't understand how her grandmother could be so different all the time. It scared her. Some days Grandma had a big smile and a warm welcoming voice, but other days she stole things and was grumpy with everyone.
</p>
<p>It made her mad. It's not fair that Grandma gets to take things without asking, Sofie would think. Why doesn't she let me play too? Her mother and father told her that Grandma liked taking care of the dolls and asked her to be a big girl and share nicely. “Besides,” they would say, “don’t you have plenty of other toys to play with?” Of course this was true. Sofie had trucks and video games and a very nice kitchen set that was just her size, but baby dolls were her very favorite. And they kept disappearing into Grandma's room.
</p>
<p>A few times a week, Grandma would fall asleep on the couch in the living room and Sofie would make her move. First, she would make sure that Mom was busy. Then, with soft steps and tip-toes, her rescue mission began. She would sneak into Grandma's room and look for dolls in easy-to-reach places. Like under the bed where the bald headed, brown eyed BabyBoo was stored in a shoe box. Or in the low sock drawer where a tiny plastic foot poked out between clothes.
</p>
<p>But unfortunately for Sofie her favorite doll was also her grandmother’s favorite. It was soft and squishy and heavy, like a real baby. It wore a green bow, a thin pink dress, and white shoes. Its mouth made a small 'o' shape so it could be fed a bottle of pretend milk. Grandma carried it everywhere.
</p>
<p>Sofie was very upset about this, but would never say anything to her grandmother. Talking to her was confusing and uncomfortable now. It used to be so much fun. They used to have a great time together. Grandma would cook or take Sophie out and they'd laugh and play card games at the kitchen table. That was when Grandma lived on her own.
</p>
<p>Sofie began to notice little differences around the time she turned six. Soon after her birthday, things about her grandmother started changing. She started to forget things, and Dad would have to make sure she was okay everyday. She got angry or sad all the time. So Aunt Susie would spend hours talking to her or sitting and watching. She even asked once, "Who is that girl?" when Sophie was standing right in front of her.
</p>
<p>That was when Sofie started changing. It was hard for her to be around her grandmother. There were many things that she felt she couldn’t say or do, so she stopped spending time with her as much as possible. When she visited Grandma’s house, Sofie would play outside or in another room away from the adults. Then, there started being more trips to the doctor. When that happened, Sophie was happy to sit in the waiting room with her aunt and a Gameboy.
</p>
<p>One day Grandma moved in with Sofie and her parents and began stealing the dolls. But not only dolls. She also took other small things from around the house. She liked Mom's purse and Dad's watch too. Usually Sofie's parents were able to find ways to get things back without much trouble, but sometimes it turned into yelling, which was frightening.
</p>
<p>This is why Sofie wanted to stay far away from her grandmother and simply gazed wide-eyed at the old woman in bed. Again Grandma asked for a hug and a kiss but Sofie didn't move. She wiggled in place and stayed hidden behind her mother who was helping Grandma eat. Mom noticed how she shied away and told her she could go play. She was relieved and scooted out of the room to do a jigsaw puzzle she had been thinking about.
</p>
<p>As she was fitting the last piece of the puzzle together Sofie's mother came into the room, sat down, and tickled her back and arms. She squealed and rolled and made a mess of the puzzle all over the floor.
</p>
<p>Then her mother stopped and helped Sophie sit up. She calmed her with a soft squeeze and looked her in the eyes.
</p>
<p>"Sofie," she said, "Why are you hiding from Grandma? Does she scare you?"
</p>
<p>Sofie was afraid to answer. She knew she was supposed to love Grandma and she did, but loving someone meant that you're not supposed to be afraid of them. It meant spending time with them and liking being with them. Was she a bad granddaughter if she was afraid? Was Mom going to be mad? Did she love Grandma the way she was supposed to? She didn't know what to say.
</p>
<p>She looked down at the puzzle pieces that were scattered on the floor. She didn’t get a chance to see them all in place for very long.
