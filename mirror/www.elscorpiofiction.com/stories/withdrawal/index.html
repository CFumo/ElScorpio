		<div id='text'><p><p>An ache in my legs. Mind wandering. Focus shifts from what is before me to thoughts in my head. I have things to do, but I end up staring off to infinity. Hands trembling. I feel the ache in my chest. An incessant urge to get comfortable. Is this Restless Leg Syndrome? I hate it. Anything to relieve the pain.
</p>
<p>Melancholy leading up to this- a feeling of doom, as if my body knows something I don’t. I want to double over, reach into myself, and crush my heart and lungs. Feel like screaming, but it would be uncouth in public. Feel like tearing my larynx with primal roars.
</p>
<p>Arms tingling and feeling light. My skin needs to be scoured. Physical sensation may take my mind off of this. I must dig into myself. Flesh is transient. My breath catches.
</p>
<p>Speaking with people fills my mouth with clouds. A haze overcomes me. I know that I am coherent, but I have a deep fear that I’m not- that they’ll see through me. My biceps scream. I feel a dizziness.
</p>
<p>My throat is dry. Is it because I hadn’t eaten? I don’t remember when I last drank. So very thirsty, but I loathe the thought of nourishing myself. I feel so very happy, but the sense of doom is unavoidable.
</p>
<p>Feeling the spikes of pain in my hips. My muscles are spasming. Face feels like it has a mind of its own. I stare at a mirror. Much to my amusement, I am a mask of calm. A foil to my internal anguish and mania. Shuddering breaths. I smell bile.
</p>
<p>Only a few ways out, one hinging on powers beyond my control. I hate this. I love this. A sensation so unlike normalcy. I am on the floor. People walk past- unconcerned. Is this normal? How can that be? A herd grows stronger when some of the members die out. This is how the culling feels. I must become a husk to regrow and become my next iteration.
</p>
<p>Will doing it again recreate this endeavor, or make me be at peace? If it’s the former, I can grow to love the experience. Well worth it.
</p></p></div>
