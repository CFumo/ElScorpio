		<div id='text'><p><p>Four things sat on Anya's mantle. The first, there mostly out of habit, a frame holding Anya's certificate of graduation with a degree in mechatronics. It was dusty, save for a few fingerprints left during her recent move.
</p>
<p>Next, a picture of Anya with Graham soon after they had fallen in love. It had been taken at one of his company events. They had been oblivious to the photographer so neither was turned towards the camera. Her hand caressed his jaw, a playful pout on her lips. Graham was grinning goofily. Anya had been trying to tell him about a chocolate smudge on his face, while he teased her, pretending to not know where it was. The moment she realized Graham was toying with her had been immortalized and the photograph became a shared favorite.
</p>
<p>Beside this picture was another, of a young girl and boy. Neither of these children existed. For Anya's birthday, Graham had given her a digital rendering of the children they could have together, had they been allowed. He knew she longed for them, though she'd rarely admit it. What Graham hadn't expected was that she would burst into tears immediately upon seeing it. The once raw what-could-have-been had since softened so that Anya now looked at the picture with tenderness. It was a gesture of Graham's love, as he tried to give her a piece of her impossible dream.
</p>
<p>Finally, was Graham's last letter, now framed for preservation. It had a few additions since he'd written it: deep creases from repetitive folding and unfolding, water damage from Anya's tears, and notes Anya had scribbled to highlight important words.
</p>
<p>These items made up Anya's most cherished possessions. But they had been starved for human attention for ten days. Anya had not been home.
