		<div id='text'><p><p>I am comfortable with the night now. Have you ever run through a pitch-black forest? No? It can be a little nerve-wracking. What kept me going was the knowledge that soon day would dawn. I was young then. I don't know what keeps me going now. Well, no. I do know. I'm not going to give them what they want. I'm not going to destroy everything. Even if they have. Even though they have obliterated the sun, the moon and boiled the oceans. The only warmth is the cooling Earth.
</p>
<p>At least we have the stars. There must be life out there. Maybe life that has persevered. I don't know how. They must have met them. An instant, and the ghost is before you. Its thin gaze drains your soul. You turn to run, but already it's gone. Fight it? There is nothing to fight. It kills in an instant. There is no reprieve, either. We drilled miles, tried all manner of shields. No effect.
</p>
<p>We attempted an evacuation in the beginning. It was quite a feat. A last ditch effort. There weren't many left to evacuate by the end. Those who made it on the ship perished with it. The last message was a few months into its journey. They were past Jupiter. The ghosts swarmed it and killed everyone inside just by turning the engine off. Like they were extinguishing a match. We thought of another try, maybe multiple vehicles. But there weren't enough of us left to even begin.
</p>
<p>They have spared those who are left. It's been years since I've seen them close. In the sky, high above; that's where they've all settled, to serve as a reminder. To remind us that nothing we do will defeat even one of them. To remind us that we can't be saved. To remind us that we will die here soon.
</p></p></div>
