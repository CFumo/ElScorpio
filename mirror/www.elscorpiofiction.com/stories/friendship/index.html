		<div id='text'><p><p>Jake woke up in a cold sweat.  No, it smells. It was his own vomit. Fuck.
</p>
<p>Jake, mercilessly hungover, rolled out of it. Shakily, he stood up, praying it hadn't soaked through the ikea rug he slept on into the carpet.  He scoured his memories for any recollection of what he had drank last night to avoid drinking it ever again but couldn't remember. Fuck.
</p>
<p>Managing to shuffle to the living room, Jake immediately collapsed on the couch and closed his eyes.  His head was pounding.
</p>
<p>"Wake up." he grumbled, prodding the seemingly lifeless mass unconscious on the floor next to the couch with his foot.
</p>
<p>"Dude... are we still alive?..." Evan whimpered, realizing he was shivering and naked, save his boxers, as he meekly tugged a blanket off the couch.
</p>
<p>"No. This is hell." groaned Jake, still unable to open his eyes.  The pounding in his head was unbearable.  A feeling of nausea overwhelmed him as he shuffled in vain to find a position on the couch that didn't make his entire body ache.
</p>
<p>"Dude.... Dude!...." Evan rolled over on his belly, face flat on floor. "...Last night was such a success though!" He kicked his feet with glee; Jake's stomach turned.
</p>
<p>"I know. Shut up."  Even through the pain, a smile still managed to push its way onto Jake's face.  He really had done it.
</p>
<p>Evan managed to pull his body up to rest his head on the edge of the couch, inches from Jake's.  He gave Jake an impish, knowing grin. "I'm proud of you, buddy. You always said it.  You always said the problem was women, not you, but you finally fucking did it!" Evan laughed as he layed back down on the floor. "Well, you and some alcohol did it."
</p>
<p>Jake rolled over to look at his friend.  He still had a weak but calm smirk on his face, and his eyes looked lost in thought as he tried to piece together the previous night. "I guess I really did..."  He rolled back over as his smile grew, now staring at the cieling.
</p>
<p>"...Thanks, man..."
</p>
<p>Evan shot bolt upright, putting his hand on Jake's shoulder. "Dude, you know I'm always there for you!  I gotta help my homie!"  His face beamed with pride.
</p>
<p>Jake gave Evan a light punch on the shoulder and smiled back at him. "Now get outta my way, I think I'm gonna puke..."
</p>
<p>Jake slowly shambled down the hall towards the bathroom.  The baseball bat was still leaning against the hallway wall.
</p>
<p>"Man... the problem's always been women." Jake thought to himself. "The booze definitely helped my confidence, but the problem's always been women, though..."
</p>
<p>The bat still shined with coagulated blood from the previous night.
</p>
<p>"The problem's always been women. And that fucking hooker got what she fucking deserved."
