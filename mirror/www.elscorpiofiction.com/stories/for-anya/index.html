		<div id='text'><p><p>Four hours. That's all the time I have left in this world, Hon. That's all they're giving me. I should run to a sperm bank. I should fly a kite. Do something out of the ordinary. But instead I'm writing this note for you and posterity. Except unless I run to that sperm bank, there won't be any posterity to write to. My genes won't be splashing in the pool anymore. That doesn't make me sad though. I forgot what that feels like. All my hard work, and the execution is something beautiful. What a pay off. The anti-emotion medicine is really doing the trick. I already don't care about the fact I'm going to die in less time it takes to ride the hyperloop to China. It's great. Really great.
</p>
<p>I understand why they need to do it. They showed me the video. Fifty billion humans fumbling about on this planet, and anyone like me, past their productivity prime, needs to be set aside for future versions of world-conquerors. I did a lot with my allotted thirty years. I helped save the future. I did my time in the lab to develop the most humane form of euthanasia ever, and now I'm experiencing it firsthand. What an honor. I'm proud. Really proud.
</p>
<p>The nursing and admin staff is swell here. They've even got a guy who rummages through all of my social media footage ever recorded and puts a nice slide-show together of the highlights for me. Just saw that one photo of you and me in that old WWI tank. Three world wars ago! I know we felt very happy that day. Remember how you swung from the tank's nozzle thing when the guards weren't looking? And then you fell off laughing and landed on your butt? I know we were laughing so hard.
</p>
<p>I want to let you know that it's really working. I really don't care. And it's a great thing. I'm not going to feel any pain, I don't think. Once they plug me in and I breathe the leaden breath of death; that purple gas I helped develop flowing in from those delightful friendly-looking dispensers. Apple really did a great job with those. So sleek and user-friendly. Hon, I'll be sure to send a Snapchat your way just before it happens so you can watch.
</p>
<p>This sure takes a while. About three hours left. Time sure ticks! Still feeling good I guess. I think it's still working. It's really hard to think of more to say to you. They've got a few prompts and preset messages that I could copy and paste, but none of them really fit my personality. You'd know it wasn't really me. And I don't want that. I want you to know that it's really me sending this to you because you matter to me, Hon. I want you to know that when they reconfigure my parts and wipe my memory, there will always be a place inside me for you.
</p>
<p>I can feel the second part of the meds kicking in, Hon. I'm scared. I'm not supposed to feel afraid. I'm writing you before my brain goes under. I want to let you know. I'm afraid. I failed, Hon. I need to let you know. I don't believe that video they showed anymore. I've got more I need to say. Go into my office now. Now. I left something there. It's directions. For.. My mind is slowing. It's slow. ing. Escape. Hon.
