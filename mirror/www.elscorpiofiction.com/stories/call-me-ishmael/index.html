		<div id='text'><p><p>Whenever I get antsy, I go a-squidding. I travelled to Nantucket to join up with a squidding ship, Nantucket being the de facto capital of the squidding industry. I put myself up at a shabby hotel—the best I could afford—then took myself down to the docks to find work.
</p>
<p>I struck up a conversation with Captain Timmon, one of the owners of the Damascus.
</p>
<p>“You look hardy enough,” said Captain Timmon. “You’re hired.”
</p>
<p>“Capital,” I said. “When can I speak with Captain Joab?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, he keeps to himself mostly. A very gloomy and secretive man, ever since he was disfigured by the infamous Brain-Squid. Some say he’s gone completely mad! Say that he’s vowed revenge against the Brain-Squid, and would travel to hell itself to see the beast slain. Those are just rumors though.”
</p>
<p>The Captain chuckled heartily and slapped me on the back.
</p>
<p>The next day I boarded the Damascus with my fellow crewmen, eager to begin the voyage. For days we saw neither head nor tail of Captain Joab, who remained confined to his cabin, allowing his mates to orchestrate our departure.
</p>
<p>It was on the third day—a dark day, with no wind to dispel the cloying mists—that the Captain appeared. He was tall and gaunt, with a menacing aspect. His spidery hands held the balustrade in a white-knuckled grip, jagged fingernails digging into the wood. My gaze traveled up his looming frame, over his worn boots and hunched shoulders, and with a shock of horror and revulsion I finally saw his disfigurement. He had a peg head.
</p>
<p>The first mate approached the Captain and whispered something into the peg, which nodded in response. I couldn’t stop staring. It looked like someone had just jammed a wooden peg into his neck. I wondered what in the seven hells was going on here. The peg moved again, and I felt a mass of bile moving up my throat. I felt faint. I searched the faces of the other crewmen for some hint of the alarm which afflicted me. No one gave the peg a second glance. Was I the only one who could see it? I closed my eyes, rubbed them, and opened them again. I saw the first mate lean in to whisper once more and wondered how he could stand being so close to it. How was it attached? By what mechanism was the motion of the peg motivated? I thought back to the medical texts I’d consulted during my time at university, then shook my head. Ludicrous to try to apply that knowledge here. It simply wasn’t physically possible.
</p>
<p>I had heard of chickens living days or even weeks without their heads, but a human? I just couldn’t see how he was still alive. I watched him surreptitiously as I swabbed the deck, though of course it was impossible to tell whether he intercepted my gazes. I felt an atavistic sense of revulsion. But… was it possible that the whole thing was some sort of ruse? An elaborate practical joke? If that was the case then I wasn’t amused, though I certainly had to admire the crew’s commitment to their hazing ritual. Maybe they’d be better off on a stage than on a deck. But I didn’t really believe it. There would surely be visible puppet strings or some notion of a puppet master.
</p>
<p>Maybe the answer was staring me in the face. Maybe I was insane. Was it a reaction to the bitter grog that the crew was so fond of? Or an exotic fever contracted from the isles nearby? Was I even on a ship? Am I real?
