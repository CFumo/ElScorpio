		<div id='text'><p><p>In a tiny mid-city apartment, kitty-corner to a chain supermarket, a crime scene was under investigation. The naked corpse of a woman lay on the splintered remains of her coffee table. Her blood covered the carpet and the couch and was splattered wildly against the far wall and the window. The major bones in her arms and legs had been violently removed, along with most of her ribs, but the rest of her skeleton was intact. Little wisps of something like silk or spiderweb clung to her fingers and hair.
</p>
<p>Detective Aldous Blackwing slipped under the crime scene tape to get a closer look. The body was reasonably fresh. A few hours prior, a neighbor heard screams and horrific noises and called the police. Aldous couldn’t believe the amount of blood—it seemed excessive.
</p>
<p>His partner Jack Bennett was already there.
</p>
<p>“Grisly, isn’t it?” he said.
</p>
<p>Aldous nodded. This was the fourth victim they’d found in this condition. Apparently they were dealing with a serial killer, or worse.
</p>
<p>Bennett leaned in conspiratorially. “You thinking what I think you are?”
</p>
<p>He was. He’d had his suspicions when they found the first body, but now he was sure. The perpetrator wasn’t as careful this time, and he could just make out the marks of dark sorcery around the victim’s eyes, wrists, and genitals.
</p>
<p>“Something nasty had its way with her,” said Aldous, under his breath. “I need to see if I can get any more information.”
</p>
<p>Bennett said, “Ok, go do your magic trick.”
</p>
<p>Aldous left the room and went out into the hall. Bennett was one of only a few humans who knew his secret, which was that he was not human. Not entirely. Aldous was a quarter angel, and a quarter demon, which left him with the ability to transform and pass into the other realm.
</p>
<p>He looked back and forth across the hallway, making sure he was unobserved, and then he changed. As always the transformation was excruciatingly painful. Every muscle began to throb, and his skin felt like it was being peeled off in strips. His fingernails lengthened into claws. A sharp pain constricted his chest, making it difficult to breathe, and he felt his vestigial wings break through the skin of his back.
</p>
<p>He stumbled and caught himself against the wall, gasping. The two realms must have intersected closely at this location, because the hallway looked mostly the same. “Rough entrance?” said a croaking voice. The speaker approached—he was half human, half frog.
</p>
<p>“Hi Mud,” said Aldous. He blinked against the pain, which had not abated after his transformation, and would not as long as he remained in this form. He also began to feel the sourceless dread and disgust which always accompanied him in the other realm. He felt like a huge, endless scream was echoing just below the range of his hearing. From experience he knew that this feeling would not leave him either.
</p>
<p>Mud laid a webbed hand on Aldous’s arm. The clammy touch did nothing to ease his misery, but he appreciated the gesture.
</p>
<p>“What are we looking for, Blackwing?”
</p>
<p>“Something collecting human bones.”
</p>
<p>“Everyone and their mother collects human bones on this side. What else?”
</p>
<p>“Collecting them from live victims. Just limbs and chest.” He struggled to think through the haze of pain. “They left webs on the body.”
</p>
<p>“Hmm…” Mud thoughtfully licked his eyeball. “That does narrow it down. Come on, chief.”
</p>
<p>Mud helped Aldous into a shuffling jog. The outside of the building looked similar to the apartment in the human world, but exponentially taller, rising infinitely into the boiling dark red sky. Many nearby buildings were absurdly tall, though the chain supermarket across the street was almost identically squat and mundane.
</p>
<p>As they ran, the similarities to the human city faded away. They passed dilapidated crystalline structures, still shimmering with a faint angelic radiance, and long fields where the stinking red-black earth was cut with comically neat rows of moldering carnage. Aldous saw a herd of giant beasts pass in the distance, and still that infernal screaming played forever just below the reach of his ear.
</p>
<p>They crossed into another convergence point, entering a weird distortion of the Main Street Station area. Mud led them down a raw, bone-lined hole into one of the many subway tunnels. The tunnels were thick with gore, except in places where the tracks stretched out across cavernous black voids, which Mud and Aldous crossed with excruciating care. The increasing size and frequency of spiderwebs signaled their proximity to Dr. Kumohito’s lair.
</p>
<p>They found him deep in his laboratory, hunched over a table strewn with beakers, bones, and sigils. Kumohito was human in body, but he had a whole tarantula for a head. He turned toward them as they entered, mandibles snapping, eight legs wiggling. No—seven: one was missing.
</p>
<p>“The jig is up, you fuck,” said Mud. He was still supporting most of Aldous’s weight, but now Aldous pushed away from him, nauseous with pain and barely standing. He sank into a crouch and blood began to drip from one eye as he prepared to attack.
</p>
<p>“No!” shouted Kumohito. “You meddlesome fools! The birthing ritual must be completed!”
</p>
<p>Mud looked away as Aldous sprang for the doctor. He didn’t want to see this. Bad enough to hear the wrenching clangs and shrill whistling set against Kumohito’s screams. When the noise died down he turned and saw that Aldous was lying facedown in the blood and dirt, and Kumohito was unambiguously dead.
</p>
<p>Mud carried Aldous back to the surface to a high-convergence location, so he would materialize somewhere sane when he woke up and changed back. The “Bone-Napper” case would eventually be filed away as another unsolved string of murders. But the humans were safe once again. For now.
