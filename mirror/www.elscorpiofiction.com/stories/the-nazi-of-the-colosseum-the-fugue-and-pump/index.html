		<div id='text'><p><p>23 March 27 BC
</p>
<p>Hans Klein bore the weight of the improvised barbell- a thick log with soaked mooring ropes wrapped carefully around the ends. The monolith of a man stood before the Ara Pacis, the altar of peace. With a loud exhale a series of muscles, beginning at his powerful calves, all along his triangular back and shoulders, to his massive biceps, stirred to life. <em>One</em>, the German counted as his forearm cleared the ninety and swung towards his shoulders. A long inhale through the nose as the log lowered.
</p>
<p>Scented oils reminded Hans of how far he was from his home. He missed the sweet smell of vollkornbrot that permeated the air during the formative youth rallies. Gone was the distinctive talc powder scent of the exercise room where he laughed heartily with Gerhard and Oskar. <em>Two.</em> The champion’s cephalic veins bulged as the 140 pound log made its way upwards. At the end of his exhale, Hans noted the stone carvings on the cubic altar room before him. His spirit was lifted by the austere and precise architecture- so similar to the construction of the best city in the world. Berlin.
</p>
<p>As Hans lowered the great weight, the young Adelpha sighed to her slave, Barnabus. “Do you think that Hans will enjoy the clothes that you made me?” Adelpha was encased in a flowing skirt and drooping shirt, resembling 1920’s German fashion. Barnabus, the small and clever man inducted into involuntary service when his town was sacked by the Roman legion, was a master tailor. He spent a full day trying to replicate the clothes described by Adelpha, after she overheard Hans’ feverish sleep talking. Barnabus was out of his element, but making such stylish clothing felt right, somehow. If only he could do the ultimate style justice.
</p>
<p>The tailor responded with sincerity, “I pray to my gods and yours that he does, Adelpha.”
</p>
<p><em>Three.</em> The burly man strained once more, and lifted the log. A bead of sweat welled from within his hair- close-cropped on the sides and moderately long at the top. Hans felt the sweet ache in his engorged biceps and thighs. This was his sixths set of curls, and he was starting to feel the burn. Before the next rep, Hans readjusted his hands in the deep grooves cut in the wood. This was the last exercise of the day and he wanted to burn out before plunging into a frigidarium.
</p>
<p><em>Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight.</em> Hans panted heavily. The familiar numbness settled in his working muscles. If only his father could see him. A colonel in the German military during World War I, Fritz Klein always encouraged his only son to be strong in body and mind. It was a sad day for Hans and his mother, Ana, when Fritz was declared Missing in Action during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel. <em>Nine. Ten.</em> A lone tear rolled down Hans’ cheek. He recalled how devastated his mother was. To have lost such a strong man. To leave her two children- one unborn, without a strong father figure. It was the day Hans decided to fully give himself to his country.
</p>
<p><em>Eleven. Twelve.</em> His biceps screamed. Almost completely pumped. A normal man would have lost form; someone less perfect would have given up. Hans spotted a carving of a proud eagle. <em>Thirteen. Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen. Seventeen. Eighteen.</em> Hans dropped the weight, on the floor; Adelpha felt the vibrations through the thick concrete ground. The steamy man turned to her and Barnabus and smiled- the first smile she had seen directed at her. Adelpha swooned.
