		<div id='text'><p><p>He was late again; she wasn’t surprised. Dinner was long spoiled: hers gone and his cold. She waited at the table, wondering how long she’d be there this time. The flowers he’d brought her last week were dwindling. She got rid of them as they withered, but now it was a measly three. She fingered one gently.
</p>
<p><em>I could easily crush you. It’s the only power I have. But then again, aren’t you already dead?</em>
</p>
<p>She laughed in dry amusement and the sleeve of her silk blouse slipped off her shoulder. Once a clear blue that matched her eyes, the pattern had faded to a dirty-dishwater color. Maybe it still matched her eyes.
</p>
<p>“I should just leave him,” she told the resilient buds. They drooped in agreement. “But what would become of me?”
</p>
<p>Joyous laughter flashed through her mind. A handsome suitor taking her coat. A proposal in Paris. But then the word - divorcee - evaporated her fantasies. No one would want her after him. The melancholy emptiness of being alone filled her desolate spirit. Staying here, at least, she might have a child. That would be at least one person to love her. The hint of a smile graced her lips as a plan began to form in her mind.
