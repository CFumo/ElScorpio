		<div id='text'><p><p>Set out prospecting last. Yep. Saw the seam. Looked good. Vascular, almost. I’m a simple man with a simple story and I don’t have fancy tools. So I started the gash with a good old trench digger. Little by little, they say. I don’t fancy myself a follower, so I do the whole vein with one pass. Gonna be cutting away the same amount anyway. Why not pace back and forth while I’m at it. Less boring.
</p>
<p>Got to the point where I started hitting mud. Earth’s blood welling between layers of the white and pink rock. Done this a hundred times. Scares some of the greenthumbs. Think they’ve gone too deep. No no. There’s a lot this crust hides. Certainly a lot more than the pittance THEY are happy with finding.
</p>
<p>Now, as I said, I’m a simple man. With that comes the simple understanding that after my little girl and boy got in the accident, I stopped having much to live for. Not even more little ones to have with Juniper. Died during childbirth of our second. Many do- I suppose I should be thankful to God about our first not being a problem.
</p>
<p>So now, I can go deeper than most. What with their inhibitions of safety and the concern for their loved ones- they can’t have the attitude that I have. I’m free, I reckon. So I dig deeper.
</p>
<p>Reached more of the white stone. Spongy stuff. The more I furrowed the surface, the farther the red stone moved, as if repulsed by big old magnets. I walked off after a few runs- after the real paydirt started to get uncovered. Had to clean my tools and wash out the gash. I know, I know- why waste all the product? Like someone said, you gotta spend money to make money. And I know that the enormous amount of fluid was paltry in comparison to what is truly deep inside. Just requires more work. And more danger.
</p>
<p>Got back into the seam after letting the drying towels do most of their job. Started cutting. Consistency is key, you see. Can’t cut willy-nilly. It’s real easy when you can see the seam, but when the stuff starts coming, all you’ve got to go on is intuition and luck.
</p>
<p>A breach in a larger vein almost swept me away then and there- nicked something good and the sides parted like the Red Sea for Moses. Got out of the hole after a bit of a panic. Even for a man with nothing to lose, there’s a reptile brain trying to keep the machinery running. Or so I think anyway.
</p>
<p>I didn’t mention it before, but there was a second vein that I was going after during the drying breaks of the first one. Smaller, but it still bulged with promise. While letting the torrent run off, I shook myself off like some sort of hound-dog and went back to the second furrow. Must have had a case of nervous shakes from that near accident because I did the exact same thing to this wound in the Earth. No spouting of the precious essence, but it sure expanded quickly.
</p>
<p>That didn’t sit well with me. My digger hadn’t been sharpened by the smithy in a while and to do the really fine, dangerous work, you need a keen tool. Perhaps next time. At least I’d collected enough to be sanguine for a while longer.
