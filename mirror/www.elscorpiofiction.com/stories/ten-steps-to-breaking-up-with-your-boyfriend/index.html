		<div id='text'><p><p>1. Suggest you go to a nearby restaurant you both like. Keep it casual. Be careful not to mention anything about "having a talk." Split the bill so he doesn't feel like you were taking advantage of him later.
</p>
<p>2. On the car ride home, be quieter than usual. He'll know something is on your mind. When you get home, sit on the couch. Ask him to join you.
</p>
<p>3. Tell him things have been off lately. Confess you haven't been happy in awhile. Don't cry too much.
</p>
<p>4. When he protests, bring up how he didn't think you would get your job. How he said you were under qualified. Remind him of his short temper and how you're tired of putting up with it.
</p>
<p>5. Let him shout a little. It will only last a few minutes before he starts crying. Pat his head. Tell him you know he'll find someone who won't demand so much of him. Say that you're not the right person to make him happy. You can cry a little too.
</p>
<p>6. When he clams down, give him a hug. If he learns in for a kiss, allow it, but nothing more. Tell him that you hope you'll remain friends - that he's your best friend and you want him to stay in your life, in some capacity.
</p>
<p>7. Agree not to talk for the next few weeks but to remain friendly. Unfollow each other on social media. While you're at it, change your profile picture.
</p>
<p>8. Pack up his things that are around the house. Decide to have him drop off your stuff tomorrow afternoon.
</p>
<p>9. Stand up. Walk him to the door, and give him a long heartfelt hug. Tell him you miss him already. Say goodbye.
</p>
<p>10. Call up your best girl friends to come over. Open bottles of wine. Cry.
</p></p></div>
