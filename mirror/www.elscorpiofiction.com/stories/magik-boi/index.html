		<div id='text'><p><p>So, I’m magic. I can literally do magic. I can turn water to wine, lead to gold, sickness to well-being. I’m not sure if I’m a wizard or a god or a demon, but I can do anything that I can imagine. The only problem is that I have to get really drunk or high to start being able to alter reality. Not just a couple of glasses of wine drunk; more like a few bottles shit-faced. If I pop a few benzos or mainline some brown, the magic comes quicker and stronger. My ability to do otherworldly things is inversely related to my how much in control of my own mind I am.
</p>
<p> I discovered my abilities when I got crossfaded in high school. It wasn’t good. I annihilated my best friend Karen’s house. I guess I thought how weird it would be if Karen and I were hanging out in a meadow, making s’mores. Sure enough, we were in a meadow cooking marshmallows over a flame. In Tarzana. Between two mcmansions and an Arby’s. Karen wasn’t mad- she didn’t even realize that anything was different. Seems reality had bent around my alteration. I felt bad about it. Karen was homeless and she had no parents. I tried helping a few weeks later and just made her disappear. That was shitty…
</p>
<p> I tried doing good with my powers for a few years, but it never works out. I’m either an angry drunk or a wild, promiscuous pothead. Those mindsets don’t lead to responsible uses of unlimited power.
</p>
<p> I got pretty depressed in college. After a stint in the county drunk tank, I sort of stopped caring about much. I get high a whole lot now. Nothing around me is normal anymore. Most of my acquaintances have been changed beyond belief and my home state is more or less a wasteland. Just writing this to give an explanation of all the supernatural things that are going on in the Eastern US. I’m gonna eat a few rat poison pellets. Maybe it’ll reverse all the things I’ve made happen?
</p>
<p> …or fracture the planet and kill all living things.
