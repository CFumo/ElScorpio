		<div id='text'><p><p>The battlefield resonated with clashing, screaming, grunting, and cursing. The air was as thick with sound as the ground with bodies and trampled grass. Chaos echoed against surrounding trees as the expanse of glade rippled with violence. The first wave of combat was dying by blade and arrow, bludgeon and tooth.
</p>
<p>Hendra surveyed the tumult of limbs and iron from her cover in the trees, tensely waiting to be released. Feet gripped the earth. Muscles in her legs strained in place. Broad shoulders gathered near her spine like walls of a canyon.  Remembering her training, she quelled her mind with the purity of rage.
</p>
<p>Then, a high oscillating yowl pierced the blanket of noise. It careened over clangs of weapons and armor. Hendra unfurled herself at last.
</p>
<p>Wild red hair streamed behind as she charged through the last of the forest and out to the open fight. She propelled herself with determination, stepping on and over bodies while swinging a short sword. Her sprint ended abruptly about two hundred paces from the enemy line. Behind a small pile of dead men, she planted her circular shield in the ground with a quick thrust. The sword dropped from her hand as she stretched over her shoulder for a short bow. Leaving the grapples and duels to her back, she surveyed the field in a patient crouch. She was only a middling archer, but learned the basics well and began to channel her form and breath.
</p>
<p>Memories emerged.
</p>
<p>Quiet days in her forest alone with beasts and trees. Seasons changing as she practiced the magic of roots and herbs. Hendra meditated for long afternoons on the pulse of creation; lingered over the minutest details of flowers and brush; loosed her consciousness to the edges of the region. She was aware, of course, of the barbarian tribe, as much as the dormouse colony or the nesting wren. They hunted and built simple homes as many other creatures in the land did. Their pack migrated for the winter like birds and fish. On rare occasions, Hendra traded her skills in healing for spices and bulbs from foreign climates.
</p>
<p>These were her allies. They hurled themselves at the enemy as she sent volleys of arrows toward the advancing foe. They taught her how to wield a sword and shield, how to tackle a man and pierce between plates of armor. When a far off kingdom announced its intention to take the land, they prepared for its defense.
</p>
<p>When word reached Hendra, at first she did nothing. The machinations of civilized men were of little interest to her. Indeed they had no more impact on the place than the barbarians. A few settlements appeared just outside the tree line. Children collected fallen nuts and seeds. Men brought home venison and made clothes of hide. She was left undisturbed and continued her pleasant routine in the bramble depths as before.
</p>
<p>Then came the loggers and the builders. They quickly wiped out whole swaths of woodland. The flora and fauna trembled. The druid felt the initial grip of fear as home spoke to her of danger. Although she knew creation and regeneration magic, she would not be able to maintain sufficient growth against the multitudes that flooded in each day.
</p>
<p>The barbarians had already been involved in skirmishes and raids to deter the progress of the kingdom. Their familiarity with the terrain and with conflict gave them some advantage. Still, they saw Hendra as a weapon to be honed and employed when the time was right. After months of arduous struggle against deforestation and invasion, she embraced that vision. She adapted quickly though she had not spent time with humans in many years. Her mother had raised her in near solitude in the plains. As a child, she was encouraged to cultivate her connection with the earth, and in adolescence, deemed ready to answer the call of this particular forest. They knew each other from her dreams. They understood each other as she traversed its expanse. It was her friend, her soulmate. She would defend her beloved with her life.
</p>
<p>On the morning of battle, Hendra prepared herself. She fixed all her wondrous energies upon a singular purpose. The barbarians had transformed her love into a precise, fanatical violence against those who would destroy its object. However, before the sword, the shield, or the bow, there was the magic.
</p>
<p>Her arrows spent, Hendra climbed out from behind the shield as the next wave rushed forward. The barbarians began their retreat. She stood ready.
</p>
<p>The first men to reach her were felled by the swift force of her blade. But most men raced passed to claim the trees ahead. She dodged and rolled as a swarm flooded by, staying in the center of the clearing even as row upon row of army charged. When she could feel the pounding of boots all around her and sense a dark presence filling her treasured space in every direction, the time had come.
</p>
<p>The druid woman knelt in the dirt with her eyes to the sky. A soaring song of gratitude rang through her mind as she retrieved a small pouch from within her armor.  Inside was a sparrowâ€™s egg, a sprig of rosemary, and ash of the old forest. A chant fell gently from her lips as the bag began to burn. She hugged it to her chest and let it scorch.
</p>
<p>A ring of flame exploded from the center of the clearing. For several acres, every tree, branch, and leaf burned. Every living being burned. Where they died, there would be new growth, protected by a loving presence. No man would ever be able to step where she resided. The spirit now ran through the ground, danced with the roots, and breathed with the flames. Her beloved was with her, safe and warm.
