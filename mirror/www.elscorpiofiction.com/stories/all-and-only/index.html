		<div id='text'><p><p>“Spank me, granny.”
</p>
<p>Cosmo winced as a firm hand answered his request. He was punished for being cheeky. His rear blushed and blood rushed to his face with pleasure. He was on the edge of tolerable sensation when the bindings bit into his wrists and another slap met supple skin. It suddenly became too much. An audible exhale escaped his lips as he came with surprising force.
</p>
<p>From his position on knees and elbows, he fell into a resting kneel. Sweat dripped down his arms to where his wrists were bound in a position of offering. Dolores smiled. Seeing her toy reach his limits was endlessly satisfying.
</p>
<p>“Done so soon?” Dolores practically purred as she ran her wrinkled fingers down the young man’s back. He shivered and then rolled over in response.
</p>
<p>“Hah. Yeah.” Cosmo gave an exhausted smile. “Enterprise. I’m done.” He held his hands up, indicating that he’d like to be untied.
</p>
<p>The safe word ended the play, but Dolores wasn’t disappointed. It had actually been a wonderful game of endurance that evening. A sheen wet her body all over as well. She sat down on the bed and released her gray hair from its high bun before leaning over to attend to the restraints. Cosmo waited quietly. Her hands were not as steady as they used to be, but after a moment she was able to loosen the knots and release him.
</p>
<p>“Gotcha!” he shouted and immediately sprang up and grabbed her breasts impishly before surrounding her with his arms. “It’s my turn!” Her skin felt soft and delicate as he squeezed her into a gentle grapple. It rippled with his every touch. Together they rolled in bed, laughing. Her weathered eyes fell on his lithe figure and he drank in her every curve.
</p>
<p>Cosmo and Dolores enjoyed these tender moments in between other moments. In their own home, they got no stares, received no judgment. The ritual began with flirtation, built tension over time, climaxed in physical intensity, and ended with sweetness. The joy, the pain, the fun: it was all theirs and only theirs.
