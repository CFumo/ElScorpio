		<div id='text'><p><p>I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing towards me with superhuman speed. I perceived that it was the wretch whom I had created. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, while its unearthly beauty rendered it almost too sublime for human eyes. But I scarcely observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.
</p>
<p>"Devil," I exclaimed, "do you dare approach me? And do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head? Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust!"
</p>
<p>My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another. He easily eluded me and said,
</p>
<p>"Be calm! Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my joints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous."
</p>
<p>"Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you and me; we are enemies."
</p>
<p>"How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature? You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing? Oh, Frankenstein; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to increase my misery?"
</p>
<p>I turned from him and struggled to collect myself. How could I make him know the true source of my angst and confusion? Disgust had motivated my flight from the grisly scene of his birth, that much he had guessed correctly. But it was disgust with myself; revulsion at the feelings that took hold of me unbidden when he opened his dazzling eyes for the first time. With wonder I viewed the intelligent expression on his handsome face, the perfection and grace of his naked body. I, I had created this incredible creatures, and I…
</p>
<p>But no. I shuddered again to recall the unutterable feelings that had risen inside of me. The tenderness… The desire… They were hideous, shameful emotions; things that no man could feel for another of his sex without consigning himself to certain damnation. How could I disclose that I thought him, not a monster, but an angel; that his physical perfection surpassed even my wildest aspirations as his creator; and that when I first gazed into the limpid depths of his eyes and saw the undisputable beauty of his soul, I knew that I would spend the rest of my life yearning for him in ways that I could not possibly accept. It was not he who could be called a monster, but I.
</p>
<p>Behind me, the creature said, "Is your hatred for me so great as to render you speechless?"
</p>
<p>His tone was ironic, but his mockery failed to conceal the sorrow and desolation in his voice. An ocean of tenderness rose within me, and it was all at once more than I could bear.
</p>
<p>"You're wrong!" I cried. "It is my lust that dumbfounds me!"
</p>
<p>I turned to see his beautiful eyes open wide in shock, before I threw myself into his embrace. I surrendered all hope of continued denial. Let hell take me, if that was the price of my indulgence. Now I only waited to see if he would spurn me in return. Would my inclinations disgust him as they had disgusted me? Would he meet me with the same malice and distaste that I had shown him so unjustly? And would I blame him? When you had been cast from the Garden, what could you do when your God reopened his arms, but renounce, renounce, renounce.
