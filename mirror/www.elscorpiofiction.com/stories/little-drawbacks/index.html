		<div id='text'><p><p>All day she found herself lightly tracing the two small puncture wounds on her neck. They were tender to the slightest touch. Every few minutes the sting would remind her of a dream come true, a real-life fairytale.
</p>
<p>A pale stranger stood inhumanly still as a frenetic crowd danced and raved all around. Through the music and shrieks of excitement, she heard whispers full of promise, drawing her into a dark corner of the club. When the two were quite alone, there was a flash of pain and blood, a few lost hours, a deep sleep.
</p>
<p>The next morning was more vivid than anything she had ever experienced. The rainbow expanded to accommodate new hues. Her muscles seemed to hug bone imbuing every moment with a deep richness. Subtle shifts in the air told her stories from miles away. And she could take it all in with comfortable ease. She relished simple pleasures and swam fluidly through waves of thought that reached complexity and speed never before possible. Kate was so ready to be a vampire.
</p>
<p>A couple of weeks later, when her canines began to transform in her sleep, she could hardly contain herself. At first she flashed wanton smiles at work and with friends. No one noticed their subtle increase in prominence and pointedness. Ultimately the smile was for her alone, an expression of the immense pride and joy brought on by her improbable secret. At times she laughed at herself, “I’m like a teenager with a hickey, “ but the quiet indulgence was too gratifying for any real sense of shame.
</p>
<p>As more time passed, Kate was surprised by the apparent lack of bloodlust, but not disappointed. In fact, the possibility of needing to bite or kill was the only anxiety the young woman felt toward the situation. She initially anticipated a requisite moral battle with herself over fifteen years of committed veganism for, at the delicate age of six, a teacher decided to tell Kate the truth when questioned regarding “cow retirement” during a fieldtrip to the local dairy farm. At the time, the adults around her were accommodatingly bemused by her hardline, principled response. As she grew up, habit and a penchant for ethical consistency took care of the rest. Thus, it was all the more convenient when she did not begin to fade into nothingness or become a crazed lunatic without the taste of human blood. She felt fine without it or any other animal product for that matter.
</p>
<p>Hands down, being a vampire was nothing short of miraculous. Kate was faster, stronger, sharper, and more confident. She earned two promotions in a month and could bed a different man of her choosing every night of the week. It was difficult to find a downside.
</p>
<p>Except, of course, there were little drawbacks. Each night her teeth grew almost imperceptibly larger and very gradually a pallor seeped into her skin. “Maybe this is why vampires bite? For aesthetics?” A silent suspicion would occasionally surface and then be promptly subsumed by the next moment of ecstatic discovery as she felt more passionately alive everyday. She was never overly concerned about her appearance anyways.
</p>
<p>However, after several months, stares began to accumulate. Most people were polite enough not to say anything directly, but she did receive the occasional awkward comment regarding her health. In a compassionate gesture, the boss started rolling back her responsibilities when the sheer size of her canines prevented proper mouth closure. Despite Kate’s continued belief that she was only growing more effective and powerful, clients were generally put off by a woman who appeared to have an unhealthy obsession with the occult and the breathing pattern of a bulldog on a hot day.
</p>
<p>Then the growth spurts began. Over the course of a single night, her incisors changed from a pair of almonds nestled neatly over her lower lip to a couple of magnum rifle cartridges bursting from her gums. She finally decided to call in sick, but not out of mortification or panic. She spent the day admiring and caressing her ivory fangs. Hours in front of the mirror were spent in comfort and bliss. Days passed. She stayed home and took vacation time. Long, thin tusks curled passed her chin and placed a pleasing pressure just between her carotid arteries and trachea.
</p>
<p>In her sleep, she dreamed of her smile and of ripping into the necks of man and beast.
</p>
<p>Her lifelong aversion to violence made the dreams disturbing, but a moment with the mirror smothered any embryonic distress. Daily sensation was still intense and intoxicating. Pain no less so than pleasure. An obsession evolved around the prick she experienced on her own neck when she bent her head down toward her chest.
</p>
<p>There was a night when Kate dreamed with orgasmic force. She felt gripped by a womb of rolling pressure, and warmth spread through her body, head to toe.
</p>
<p>Soon her friends and family could no longer abide the silence and the police were called. After several loud knocks and warnings, they broke down the door. The apartment was dark and messy. Clothes and trash littered the ground and just about every other surface. A rank staleness hung in the air and clung to the walls of their lungs with sickening persistence. The stillness was suffocating and strange. When they reached the bedroom, a motionless figure lie before them. She was pale, naked, and lifeless. Beneath her the mattress was soaked through with blood. As best as they could tell, Kate’s canines had shot up through her throat with a violent eruption. An autopsy revealed how they carved through her brain in curlicues and wandering spirals.
