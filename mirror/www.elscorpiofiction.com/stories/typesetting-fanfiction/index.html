		<div id='text'><p><p>Rachel lay on her bed with no pants on, overheating Macbook open against her ribs, laboring	fan	burning	the	sensitive	skin	of	her	stomach.	She	smirked	and	opened	her	folder	of	rejected	El	Scorpio	submissions—the	ones	she	kept	just	for	herself—and	double-clicked	<em>Rosenbaum,	Typsetting.docx</em>.	Her	hungry	eyes	skimmed	over	the	familiar	words.
</p>
<p><em>Her	laptop	whirred	to	life,	heating	up	and	whining	as	the	bloated	Microsoft®	Office	Suite	gasped	for	RAM	eventually	forcing	a	mass	page	swap	of	a	thousand	forgotten	Chrome	tabs.	A	few	moments	later	her	computer	became	responsive	and	she	scrolled	down	and	began	reading	her	latest	entry...</em>
</p>
<p><strong><em></em><em>He	was	starting	to	get	uncomfortable	in	the	suit,	even	though	he	felt	cool	wearing	it.</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em><strong></strong></em><em><strong>“I’m	gonna	go	take	a	piss,”	he	said.	“I’ll	call	one	of	you	guys	once	I’m	holding	my	dick.”</strong></em>
</p>
<p><em></em><em>As	she	read	her	hands	slowly	found	their	way	to	the	knots	in	her	towel	and	fold	by	fold	she disrobed.</em>
</p>
<p>Rachel	pictured	Alisa	as	she	wrote	this.	Sitting	at	her	desk	in	front	of	her	computer.	She	pulls	her	hair	back	into	a	bun	and	pushes	her	glasses	up	her	nose.	Stacks	of	books	are	piled	high	on	either	side	of	her	computer,	and	a	framed	picture	of	John	Lennon	hangs	on	the	wall	next	to	a	neon	dreamcatcher.
</p>
<p><em>She	could	feel	her	cheeks	flushing	and	heartbeat	racing	as	she	became	entranced	in	the	illicit	tryst	enfolding	in	her	mind’s	eye.	Unconsciously,	her	fingers	traced	nonsense	patterns	on	her	skin	as	her	hands	inched	along	her	thighs.</em>
</p>
<p>Rachel	gasped	and	bit	her	lip,	mimicking	the	actions	of	her	double	in	the	story.	She	imagined	Alisa	typing	with	a	business-like	scowl	and	steady,	unrelenting	keystrokes.	This was	no	labor	of	love	and	she	took	no	pleasure	in	what	she	created.	This	was	serious,	cutthrough	fucking	business	and	Alisa	was	going	in	for	the	kill.
</p>
<p><em>...Then	he	had	to	slap	a	hand	over	his	mouth	to	keep	from	moaning...</em>
</p>
<p>	<em>By	now	she	was	drenched	and	with	ragged	breath	she	began	vigorously	working	her	fingers;	chasing	climax...</em>
</p>
<p>But	what	was	this?	Did	a	blush	steal	across	her	cheek?	No,	it	must	have	been	her	imagination.	Rachel	whimpered	as	she	stroked	herself	and	pictured	Alisa	picturing	her	with	what	could	only	be	calculated	indifference.
</p>
<p>A	knock	sounded	at	the	door	and	Rachel	jumped.	Yes!	This	was	the	part	of	the	story	she'd	been	waiting	for.	But	when	she	reached	the	door	and	peeped	through	the	peephole,	she	didn't	see	an	improbable	dragon	man.	It	was	just	a	blonde-haired,	average-looking	man.
</p>
<p>	She	ducked	down	under	the	peephole,	confused.	If	it	wasn't	Arren,	then	who	the	fuck	was	it?	Wait. What else had Zhenya written that month.
</p>
<p>Oh no.
