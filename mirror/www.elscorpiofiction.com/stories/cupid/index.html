		<div id='text'><p><p>Through the generations, hunters have enjoyed the sport of hunting down some unsuspecting humans and piercing their fragile little bodies. A favorite move among many is to line up a couple of saps and just let her rip. Lined up just right a hunter could affix their chest cavities by a beautiful 35" long depleted uranium tipped carbon steel polymer bolt shot off his standard issue longbow.
</p>
<p>
	Now, the play has always required some skill to count. Naturally, point-blank executions wouldn't ever be considered as sporty at all. Nobody would buy that, of course. The easiest valid play is on the common reader. A bolt through the head or the heart at an opportune time to affix the prey to their reading material does in fact count as valid, down to a range of about 300 feet*.
</p>
<p>The debate has raged on for centuries about which is considered the nobler strategy, to aim for the head, or for the chest. The chest is usually closer to the material, and thus more hunters attempt it. The results are indeed much more striking, but splitting the head clean open can have a certain lasting beauty if all goes well.
</p>
<p>Another consideration has been the forms that many artworks take. Artifacts appreciated by onlookers could be closer to the head than the heart, but is it then more skillful a shot to affix by the heart? The current rule is that as headshots go, only clean strikes count as more graceful than those that pierce through the heart.
</p>
<p>Affixing human genitalia by a piercing bolt has been argued to be unsportsmanlike play many times, but the prevailing thought still remains that skill is necessary to accomplish it, and it is thus valid and the hunter may even attempt confirmation of play, but only should he recognize the prey and indeed the play at a later date, no earlier than the morning after.
</p>
<p>The sport is currently affected by the breed of hunters who will rather attempt to gain an advantage by sheer quantity. Quality of shooting thus may have suffered overall in recent times. This is a claim often disputed, and a good example of how great quantity doesn't have to come at the cost of quality can be seen in the record-holder, Cupid, for most chest-affixing shots from a Greater Chance play.
</p>
<p>Such is his liking for quantity that a favorite play of his is the triple affixation, which will leave the targets affected for weeks at a minimum as they succumb to the wounds of his skillful shots. Some trilateral affixations have stayed attached for the lifetime of the targets, a feat unrivaled so far.
</p>
<p>The recent emergence of mechanized lovefare has many hunters very excited. With the Sports Commission ruling in February that semi-automatic handheld firearms be considered valid weaponry, the sport might soon transform radically as new ways of hunting down prey are explored.
</p>
<p>*Sports Commission Rule 1995-19: Stationary prey unobservant and otherwise grossly preoccupied in Manifested Works shall be left to Greater Chance and thus Hunter must observe and maintain raven-flight [sic] distance defined to an &gt;99.5% miss ratio.
