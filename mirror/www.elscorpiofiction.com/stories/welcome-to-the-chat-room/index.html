<p>The feed was live and the counter announced that eighty-one viewers were logged in to watch and learn. A pristine white canvas sat squarely on screen. To its left, a clean palette, a jar of water, and a square of crisply folded linen were arranged on a small table. An assortment of paintbrushes ordered by length and a row of crinkled tubes of acrylic paint sorted by hue sat in the foreground. Everything was just so, the way Abe wanted it for today’s lesson.
</p>
<p>On the camera, a red light labeled “Rec” blinked persistently. The tawny-eyed grad student took a deep breath before stepping into frame. His hair and clothing were as disheveled as his studio was tidy. To the returning viewer, he looked perhaps a tad less well kempt than usual. But fans always loved the casual approach and conversational tone as he guided them through the steps of laying out a background or adding highlights to a piece near completion.
</p>
<p>For a brief moment, some perceptive viewers thought they saw hollowness in his gaze, however, his expression quickly broke into a broad smile.  He leaned to the left to make an adjustment off screen and fiddled for a moment with something in his lap. “Uh, just a moment, folks. Thanks for stopping by today.” He checked his position on screen, scooted to the right, and ran his long fingers back through his hair to pull it away from his eyes. To watchers, he was framed by the canvas and visible from the belly up. “Ah, there we go.” The lesson began.
</p>
<p><em>Hello art lovers, creators, learners. Thank you so much for joining me once again for another installment of En Masse Art Lessons. I’m your undernourished MFA student Abe Tavern and, as always, thank you to our sponsors at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design who lend us this space.  </em>
</p>
<p><em>Hm, I see some familiar names in the chat room today. Yes. Welcome, welcome back! Hah! Yes, indeed! You have noticed, of course, the recent change in décor. Thank you! Yes, I cleaned up around the studio a bit. It’s not the usual state of disarray. I miss it too, but it was time, you know? Parents visiting soon, haha, even artists have to deal with the family. Yeah, well, let’s see…. To business!  </em>
</p>
<p><em>Ahem, in the past I have focused on the form and technique of painting, but we have as of yet to touch upon the true heart of artistry. I know some of you out there are still young or think yourself novice. You may still be reaching for technique as an ultimate end or proof of competence, but let me tell you that sitting and watching me push paint around a canvas and practicing mimicry will not an artist make. No, no. I have </em><em>tortured myself and beaten my breast at self-made comparisons between my handiwork and the handsome craft of others. Always I wished to form a line or blend shadows with greater finesse and better hands. But! But this pursuit was short sighted. I have been giving this some bit of thought and what I have determined is simple. Listen. Great art can be made by you today. You just have to be thinking about it the right way. </em>
</p>
<p><em>Let me tell you a story. It’s a true story. In fact, it happened just last week.  I was at a party and, as a young caperer is wont to do, I partook in the festivities heartily, by which, of course, I mean I drank heavily! And stupid me, I drove to the aforementioned party and I drove my good friend Mike. Now I drank and he drank and, the idiots we were, got into my car, I in the driver’s seat, he in the passenger’s. Now, now…you see where this story goes…I…I don’t have a car to drive today and I don’t have a friend named Mike to call up and play Halo with.  </em>
</p>
<p><em>Ahhhh, yes, thank you, thank you many kind folks for the condolences. Yes, yes, very sorry. Very sad. I’m quite alright; sound of body, clear of mind. And what happened? Why do I bring it up? Why indeed… Well, in that moment…when I saw Mike’s empty corpse on the ground…I saw how beautiful it all was. I felt true loss, despair, horror, panic. It was beautiful, deep, like staring into the void and hearing a choir of angels all at once.  And, upon some reflection, I realized it was pure inspiration! I experienced an experience of living art. Nothing about technique, no history, no process. Pure feeling, communication on some whole other level, an artist’s dream! </em>
</p>
<p><em>And so today’s lesson will be much like the one I experienced last week. Short, full of feeling, and, I hope, a source of inspiration to you all. </em>
</p>
<p>With a short gesture of invitation, Abe’s manic stream of consciousness ended. He extended his left arm off camera, then adjusted the rest of his posture to create the illusion that he was part of the canvas behind him, a dignitary sitting for a portrait.  Suddenly, a blast removed most of his face and head and set it dripping in dark streaks down a now tattered canvas.  His body slumped forward, exposing more of the grotesque wound to the camera, but did not fall out of the chair as he had strapped himself in during the original adjustments.
