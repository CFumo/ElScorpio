		<div id='text'><p><p>Excuse you. That’s The Artist Formerly Know as a Pimp Named Humperdinck, say the whole damn thing if you’d be so kind. I was currently heading upstairs to one of the bedrooms. A client had gotten a little too rough with one my girls, so I was swooping in for a little damage control.
</p>
<p>She was sitting on the bed in a nest of silk sheets, hugging herself and sniffling quietly. One lacy black bra strap was broken, and her large breast was spilling out of the cup. Her makeup was smeared across her green-tinted skin, and an ugly black bruise was forming over her left eye. Her small vestigial tusks bit painfully into her swollen upper lip.
</p>
<p>I sat down on the bed and put my arm around her.
</p>
<p>“Olga, what happened?” I asked.
</p>
<p>“It all happened so fast,” she said. “It was just supposed to be a normal job, maybe a little spanking, but then he started to hit me and I… I…”
</p>
<p>She put her face in her hands and started to cry in earnest. I patted her broad shoulder.
</p>
<p>“Shhh, don’t cry Olga, it’s alright. We’ll take care of the bastard. I won’t let anyone else hurt you.”
</p>
<p>She wiped her eyes and smiled. “Thanks Boss. You’re the best.”
</p>
<p>Olga bent down and unlaced my breeches, wanting to express her gratitude for my protection. I sighed and laid back with my hands behind my head, eager for the feel of her expert mouth. I loved the way her tusks looked when she did this: sharp, glistening with her saliva…
</p>
<p>Tom was jerked out of his daydream by his phone buzzing in his pocket. He was not a half-elf paladin with a successful whoring business. He was a first-year law student, still in the library at 1am on a Friday night. Again. He sighed and spent 30 seconds thinking about how much his life sucked. Then he checked his phone to see who’d texted him. Ha. The bae. He smiled to himself. Ok, so maybe his life wasn’t that bad. He put his phone back in his pocket and returned to his paper with renewed vigor. He wondered how the old D&amp;D crew was doing, and if they ever thought about him when they played.
