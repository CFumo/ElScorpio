		<div id='text'><p><p><strong>3. Int. School. Midday.</strong>
</p>
<p>DANNY, BEN, ALLISON, and SCOTT are sitting at their desks in a semicircle. Detention- something they’re used to. The high schoolers speak in hushed, yet excited tones while their docent, MR. AVERY, sleeps behind his desk.
</p>
<p>DANNY
</p>
<p>So it starts out with this MASSIVE explosion. You think that the bad guys from the other movie are totally gonna bust out with the biggest gun ever. BUT IT’S ACTUALLY MASTER CHIEF! He’s like, “is it drafty in here?” because the explosion COMPLETELY destroys the airlocks. He’s carrying a plasma accelerator from the heart of the ship that he repurposed and turned into-
</p>
<p>BEN
</p>
<p>Wait wait wait. Why is Master Chief on that ship? Didn’t he careen off Kerrigan’s mutalisk when it threw him off?
</p>
<p>DANNY
</p>
<p>Well, yeah, but he had the jet boots.
</p>
<p>SCOTT
</p>
<p>The ones you said he lost when the underwater scene happened?
</p>
<p>DANNY
</p>
<p><em>(dejected)</em> He found them again… when Count Drogo brings the boots-
</p>
<p>BEN
</p>
<p>Uhhh… whatever. I don’t actually care about the boots. The weirdest part of this is how he says that one-liner. Why would he say that? Only The Thing is there.
</p>
<p>ALLISON
</p>
<p>Cortana is still there. This is before she’s plugged into the BattleMech. A full 20 minutes before.
</p>
<p>DANNY
</p>
<p>EXACTLY! I didn’t even get to her response. It would make sense if you let me finish!
</p>
<p>BEN, SCOTT, ALLISON (in unison) FINE!
</p>
<p>DANNY
</p>
<p>Alright! Where were we. So, he’s, like, holding this massive plasma gun that he made from the ship’s accelerator core and he does the
</p>
<p><em>Danny makes the iconic shell ejection motion of a shotgun.</em>
</p>
<p><em></em>DANNY (cont.)
</p>
<p>CHUK-CHIK thing. Then Cortana wrily says “wish the breeze could air out your suit, cowboy.” And Master Chief smiles to himself as a small Decepticon comes rolling at him. He jumps and, like, floats upside-down while taking aim. The robot also starts to jump, but then the camera goes into slow motion. Master Chief has sweat on his brow. He knows that this Decepticon is also a horcrux for Voldemort, so this is a big deal. He squeezes-
</p>
<p>ALLISON
</p>
<p>Are you fucking kidding me? Voldemort?
</p>
<p>SCOTT <em>(laughing)</em>
</p>
<p>You’re taking issue with that? That’s a first.
</p>
<p>ALLISON
</p>
<p>He deserves it this time! Especially when HE BRINGS VOLDEMORT into our movie. That means that magic exists in this universe. That’s, like… stupid.
</p>
<p>BEN
</p>
<p>Actually, some say that sufficiently advanced science becomes indistinguishable from magic.
</p>
<p>ALLISON
</p>
<p>Shut the fuck up, Ben. Don’t be a ‘tard.
</p>
<p>MR. AVERY
</p>
<p>Language, miss Kang!
</p>
<p><em>Allison grimaces and flips off Mr. Avery as his eyes stay shut.</em>
</p>
<p><em></em>ALLISON
</p>
<p>Sorry! <em>(whispering)</em> Don’t fuck up our movie idea, Danny. It was your turn to write a chapter and you goofed up. You’re a piece of shit and your ideas are dumb. The only reason we said you could join is because our moms go to church together. Jesus may have helped you hang out with us, but he won’t stop us from kicking your ass.
</p>
<p>SCOTT
</p>
<p>Whoa...
