		<div id='text'><p><p><em>Please no hating. Satanic is our OC and do not steal him. Sorry for the long intro lol! Shout out to the El Scorpio readers for being supportive and NOT FLAMING. FYI Amanda: Regarding your unauthorized story about Satanic the Hedgehog. He WOULD NEVER SAY THAT TO AMY. HE IS ONLY RESPECTFUL EVEN THOUGH AMY BROKE HIS HEART. It’s fine if you use Satanic, but DOn”T lie about what he would do!  Without further ado, here is the long-awaited first chapter of Satanic The Hedgehog enjoy!</em>
</p>
<p>Satanic the Hedgehog took off his sweaty tanktop that was really tight on his chest muscles. He had just worked out with Metal Sonic and his best friend Knuckles the Echidna and they were done with their super sets for the day.
</p>
<p>“Your reps were off today, Satanic,” a voice said from the shadows of the locker room.
</p>
<p>“Are you freaking kidding me?” Satanic’s eyes flashed pure black and white. His right eye, which was silver-white was glowing white and his left eye was pure black and was glowing black.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Shadow the Hedgehog stepped out of the shadows behind the really old lockers. His arms were crossed and his gun was in his hand.
</p>
<p>“That better not be loaded,” Satanic said cooly. “You know what happened to Andrew Steinman (the stupid jock from 4th period math class).”
</p>
<p>“Sure, bud. It’s not loaded. I’m not an stupid idiot like Andrew Steinman.” Shadow responded and holstered his gun.
</p>
<p>“What the heck do you want, Shadow?” Satanic took out his favorite after-workout body spray: Axe Phoenix and sprayed. He did the cool cross spray pattern from his neck down to his private parts and along his defined abs. His signature upside down satanic cross shape. Shadow looked a little forlorn when he looked at the other Hedgehog.
</p>
<p>“I wish I could be as fast as you, Satanic.”
</p>
<p>“I was born with this speed and it is a blessing and a curse.” Satanic looked down and away and shut his eyes from the pain of knowledge. “I can run faster than any of the other Hedgehogs except for Super Sonic but every time I take a step I have to remember all of the pain i had to feel in Hell.”
</p>
<p>Shadow was amazed at Satanic and how calm he was about being in Hell. That’s how the black hedgehog with white streaks and purple streaks in his hair got his name. He forgot his name from before his damnation. He was sent there when we was doing a secret job for Tikal when traveled back in time to see her and have a date.
</p>
<p>Shadow noticed the sad look and stepped close to Satanic. He was lost in the smell of Cosmo’s workout smell. As Satanic was had tears streaming down his closed eyes, Shadow pocketed the black and white striped tank top from the locker room bench to wear to bed later. “Hey,” Shadow said stiffly. “Chin up, pal.”
</p>
<p>I looked into Shadow’s red piercing eyes and there was a moment when Satanic thought they would kiss. He was feeling very vulnerable and the cool antihero Shadow also seemed like he was vulnerable and would open up.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, Doctor Ivo Robotnik crashed through the ceiling of the gym locker room in his Angel Doom flying machine.
</p>
<p>“You are fools to be spending time here, loverboys!” He jeered loudly.
</p>
<p>Satanic and Shadow blushed and stepped away from each other, “What are you talking about EGGMAN? Are you up to your evil schemes again?”
</p>
<p>“DON’T CALL ME EGGMAN! YOU KNOW I HATE IT!” Dr Eggman spat loudly. “Besides, I don’t care about your true feelings for each other I just wanted to show you what I’ve got.” Shadow crossed his arms, “The only thing you got is STDs when you made out with Andrew Steinman last week.”
</p>
<p>The fat egg human sneered, “I don’t care what you’re saying, ShaDON’T. I have...” He opened up his trench coat. To Shadow’s surprise and horror, there were all 9 Chaos Emeralds!
</p>
<p>“You fools were playing squash when I broke into your bank vault and took your Chaos Elements! And I didn’t get the sickening diseases from Andrew Steinman because I was wearing condoms!” Eggman took out an emerald and and put it into a receptacle in Angel Doom. The machine started glowing bright green. “You’re screwed now, Hedgehogs!”
</p>
<p>Suddenly Satanic laughed, “You stupid fool. Hadn’t your boss, Evil God, told you anything?” Doctor Robotnik gasped, “What are you talking about, Satanic?”
</p>
<p>“I heard you coming to the vault and during the time Knuckles was serving the squash ball, I used my mega speed to run to the vault and replace the real chaos emeralds with fake gay glass beads!” “NO!” Doctor Robotnik tried to take out the emerald in his machine. “Evil God only warned me with his cryptic message, ‘The fastest hedgehog beside Super Sonic will foil your plans’!” His white glove turned black and burned when he touched the fake plastic. The Angel Doom that was built by Evil God could only harness the total power of the Chaos Emeralds and simple beads just made it catch fire and give idiot Eggman cancer.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Satanic laughed, “Now what are you gonna do stupid Eggman!?” Shadow stepped closer to Satanic because he was encouraged by his presence. “Yeah!” he said, as Satanic’s eyes started to glow black and white again, signalling that he was going to begin his transformation into Satanic Satanic, his ultimate form. Zhenya was ready to fight as well and he pulled out his secret SECOND pistol that he kept only for special fights alongside his best friend Satanic. (they always act like enemies but its only because they both like teasing) Suddenly Eggman laughed, because the sun was blocked out by something huge hovering over the gym...
</p>
<p><em>Okay that’s the end of chapter one but stay tooned(™) for the next chapter where Satanic and Shadow will get killed by Eggman. Haha not really but maybe...</em>
