		<div id='text'><p><p>Simon was late. He'd been too preoccupied with the morning article about the woman who had run over two children crossing the street. "Texting," it had said. He shook his head. Why couldn't everyone disconnect from technology anymore? It's why he'd never gotten a cell phone, much to his daughter's dismay.
</p>
<p>He was approaching the flower stand.
</p>
<p>"Hey there!" Sara called. She handed him a bundle of daffodils. "I was wondering where you were."
</p>
<p>He inhaled. Fresh, as always. "You're a sharp one," he chuckled.
</p>
<p>"Every Saturday, 10:30 on the dot. Don't have to be too smart for that."
</p>
<p>Simon paid her. "I'll tell the missus you said hello."
</p>
<p>He hustled to the deli. If the line wasn't long, he could still be on time.
</p>
<p>"Ahh, Simon!" boomed the voice behind the counter. "Will it be your usual?"
</p>
<p>"You know, Roy, give me some of that fancy bread today. Our 63rd anniversary is in four days and we oughtta celebrate a bit. Throw in one of those sparkling apple juices too."
</p>
<p>As Roy prepared the sandwiches, Simon looked around. The deli hadn't changed much since he'd moved there thirty-something years ago. He liked that. It's why he kept coming back.
</p>
<p>"Here you go Mister Simon." Roy handed him a bag. "And for your anniversary, it's on the house!"
</p>
<p>Simon thanked him.
</p>
<p>"See you next week, Simon!"
</p>
<p>He hurried down the street. He never liked to keep Cecelia waiting, though she'd never minded.
</p>
<p>"As long as you show up, it's worth my while," she'd said to him once. Still, he took pride in his punctuality.
</p>
<p>He got to the edge of the park and could see from a distance that their spot was unoccupied. Good. Simon made the trek past the frisbee throwers, past the couple and their dog. Halfway up their little hill, he stopped to catch his breath.
</p>
<p>"We're gonna have to get a new spot," he muttered.
</p>
<p>He reached the peak and laid down the blanket he had thrown over his shoulder. He distributed the sandwiches and arranged the flowers as he always did. He placed the sparkling cider at the center.
</p>
<p>Finally, Simon reached into his jacket and pulled out a small picture frame. "A wonderful day for our Saturday picnic!" He kissed it and placed it gently beside him. "Sara says hello. And Roy, at the deli, treated us to lunch today. An early anniversary gift. Good man. But about this spot. My dear, I'm getting old. I think we ought to find a new one..."
