		<div id='text'><p><p>Stephanie blared down the northbound 405 in her mint green El Camino. A Marlboro 100's hung lit in her mouth. The amount of near misses she had so far on her ride was staggering. Staggering, but not bewildering. So far she was scouting for her mark, steadily passing traffic. An unthinking white Lexus pulled in front, immediately forcing her to evade by passing it on the right. For good measure she unnecessarily kept it tight, risking a collision.
</p>
<p>There it was: An unassuming silver Elantra bathed in the yellow of the street lights in profile against the fast fading twilight. Alaska license plate FPD 331. Last frontier indeed. Steph swiftly stomped the pedal, breaking 85, 90, a 100, fast approaching her unassuming target. Now blazing past traffic, she sees an opening behind the mark and tests the upper limits of her All-American mechanical feat.
</p>
<p>A conscientious driver notices as she darts by his Volvo 780 semi and sounds his horn to alert her that her illegal and dangerous behavior on the road has not gone unnoticed by him, and that she should correct this immediately. It has no other effect but alerting the driver of the silver Elantra to her presence, who steps on it as he recognizes his pursuer in the rear-view mirror. After taking a slow drag of the cigarette she declares, "It's on now," and brings the vehicle to its top speed of 130 miles per hour.
</p>
<p>Though she'd have to clear some distance now, Steph knew she had the clear advantage. Quickly she gained on the Elantra as they snaked through the increasingly heavy traffic racing into Carson. The Elantra got into difficulty when a driver changed their mind about a lane change, forcing him to slow while going into the open lane. Every bit of iron will could barely contain her emotions as she cracked a smile when she closed the distance.
</p>
<p>The lane suddenly open on both sides, with ease she came up to the Elantra's side. Giving the driver the finger, she sped into the unknown.
