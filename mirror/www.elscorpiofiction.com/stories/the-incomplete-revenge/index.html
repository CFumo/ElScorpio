		<div id='text'><p><p>Bertrand hated stamps, and time travel. When he was twenty-four, a version of himself from the future—and ostensibly from an alternate timeline, judging by the absence of temporal paradox—brought him the complete collection of every stamp that would ever be printed. He'd just been a burgeoning collector then, with barely a hundred stamps to his name, and at first he'd been delighted by the gift. But his joy quickly curdled into something darker. How could he have become such a fool? Hadn't he realized that the pleasure was in the act of collecting itself? His hobby was rendered meaningless. Now he couldn't even stand to look at them, though neither could he quite bring himself to throw them away. The collection served as a reminder of what he had lost… and what he intended to gain. He smirked to himself as he tucked his revolver into his suitcase. He was going to give his friend Mallory a little visit, and beg him for the use of the time machine. He knew how things worked. He knew he couldn't change the past. This wasn't about change. This was about revenge, and he was gonna take what he could get.
