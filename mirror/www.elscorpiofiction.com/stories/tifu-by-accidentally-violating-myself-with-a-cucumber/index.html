		<div id='text'><p><p>Technically this happened last night but… whatever.
</p>
<p>Okay, so I’m a mostly boring twenty-something hetero male. I’m also single, so naturally I spend my weeknights alone in my apartment in my underwear browsing the internet watching funny videos and occasionally watching some porn.
</p>
<p>Last night started pretty normally; I made myself a ham and cheese sandwich to take into my bedroom (where my computer/desk is) so I could eat while watching some dumb youtube videos. I guess I was really tired or distracted or something because I pulled a cucumber out of my refrigerator and took it into my room along with the sandwich. I guess I was vaguely thinking that I would cut it up and eat it with the sandwich or something. I didn’t even bring a knife to cut it.
</p>
<p>I had eaten a big lunch yesterday so I wasn’t super hungry. I took a few bites of the sandwich and then sorta left it on the plate and forgot about it for a while. Well, here I was just enjoying my night watching some mini-documentary about B. B. King and how great of a guitar player he was when I see a banner advertisement for a lingerie company with a sexy girl on it. I should have just ignored it but some primal part of my mind told me to click on the ad.
</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later and now I’m on some shitty porn site watching some real dirty stuff and feeling myself up through my boxers. Well at this point I was about to grab some tissues and get it over with but when I turn to get up out of my chair I see a half eaten sandwich and a whole cucumber just lying on the plate.
</p>
<p>Call me homophobic but I was just <em>not</em> into having this cucumber in the corner of my vision while I jerked off. It looked like a dildo or something, I don’t know. I was really turned off by it. So I decided to take the cucumber back into the kitchen on my way to get the tissues.
</p>
<p>Here’s where I fucked up. I was so distracted by the stuff I had just been watching (and angry about my rapidly vanishing boner as a result of the cucumber) that I was careless about my footing as I rounded the corner to the kitchen. I don’t know exactly how it happened but somehow I tripped really hard and my arm got wedged between my hips and the wall as I was falling. The sudden motion caught me by surprise and I guess I gripped the cucumber really hard. And that’s when I landed on it. It went straight into my asshole. If I hadn’t been squeezing it so hard it might have slipped out of my hand and gone all the way.
</p>
<p>Now I want to be really clear. Just because a cucumber is vaguely phallic doesn’t mean that it feels good. They’re really really big and rough and I landed on it so hard that it ripped straight through my boxers. I screamed like I was dying. For a second I actually thought I was going to die. It hurt so bad... I can’t do it justice with words.
</p>
<p>I rolled over on my side and just laid there in the fetal position for a while. After the pain subsided a bit, I pulled the thing out as slowly and gingerly as possible. Again, searing pain like you wouldn’t believe. When I finally got it out I fuckin threw that thing into the trash can so hard.
</p>
<p>I didn’t sleep at all last night. I feel really weird and gross. I just hope I didn’t permanently damage anything in my butt. :/
</p></p></div>
