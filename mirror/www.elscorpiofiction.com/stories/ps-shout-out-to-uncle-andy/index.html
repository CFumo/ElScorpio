		<div id='text'><p><p>"Well, that doesn't look normal," thought Dennis as he stared into the mirror. Dennis started poking at the large unsightly pimple growing in the middle of his forehead. He paid no further attention to it and continued to get ready for his blind date. He didn’t know anything about her except that her name was Denise. Dennis couldn’t believe his friends set him up with someone named Denise.
</p>
<p>He put on his cufflinks and shoes before turning off the lights in his apartment.
</p>
<p>"What the fuck!?" Dennis exclaimed.
</p>
<p>He had seen a phosphorescence in his entryway mirror- a glow akin to a recently turned-off CFL. Turning on the light, he examined his zit. Sure enough, it was glimmering a pleasant, if alarming blue.
</p>
<p>"Oh, shit," he said, searching for a beanie to cover it up with. He wondered if he should call off the date in favor of a trip to the emergency room. How many words do I get? No, don't write that part. No... fuck... god damn it Rachel stop. Oh, so now you're just gonna write whatever I say, is that it? How am I supposed to finish this thing with a word limit AND a weird meta-fictional breakdown in the middle..? Can we just- Uhh...Rachel...? Rachel?! You know that blue zit? I...I think you have one too. There, on the crease of your nose. No! Don't pop it! NO! RACHEL!!!!
</p>
<p>...Rachel?
</p>
<p>"Dennis?"
</p>
<p>"Denise?" "Who's Rachel?"
</p>
<p>The silence was palpable. Dennis wasn't a great liar, or a quick wit. "Do you remember Cosmo?" She remembered more than she admitted. “I think she's his girlfriend." She knew that wasn't true.
</p>
<p>A bent blue beam pulsated over the city.
</p>
<p>She knew it was for Rachel.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the date wasn't going very well. Dennis's "pimple" stung. His thoughts felt scattered. He got the feeling he was speaking without thinking, possibly about younger siblings or old lovers, and Denise was giving him a guarded look. He meant to compliment her hair, but what he said was: “Look, is my zit still blue?”
</p>
<p>Dennis bent his head over to show Denise and then all of a sudden, a blue stream of light shot out of the zit and blinded Denise. Panic set in as Denise realized that she lost all of her sight. She screamed. Dennis tried calming her down but he had realized what he had done. Uncle Andy began to weep.
</p>
<p>His story was coming apart at the seams. He tried to make sense of all the characters and meta-fiction he'd constructed but it was no use. He'd put himself inside his own story and now it was breaking down and he couldn't get out. He looked at the reader.
</p>
<p>THE END
</p>
<p>. . .
</p>
<p>The reader blinked at the screen in confusion. What the actual fuck. The story was clearly garbage nonsense. Come on, guys, we can do better. But a slight and disturbing pressure was forming in the reader's forehead, prompting a sudden search for the nearest mirror.
</p>
<p>The reader had heard before of the power of the mind, what it could make possible...but this? This couldn't be happening. There was no way that the mysterious blue "pimple" jumped out of the story and onto the reader's face.  But the pressure was getting harder and harder to ignore, apprehensively I reached for it.
</p>
<p>Blue light filled the decaying bathroom of the abandoned JCPenney. You understand, what could not be understood. All are you. Your intent meandered into the wastelands, to build anew.
</p>
<p>Dennis congratulated you. Denise congratulated you. Rachel congratulated you. Cosmo congratulated you. I congratulated you. You congratulated you.
</p>
<p>Uncle Andy wept.
