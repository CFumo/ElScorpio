		<div id='text'><p><p>Twenty-six more heads. According to Father, it takes two hundred executions until you start to like it. Twenty-six more until he holds up his end of the deal and let's me start my apprenticeship at the bakery. I remember my first one. He was young, only a few years older than me. Caught stealing from the blacksmith and raping his wife. I didn't feel bad about that one. The crunch of the bones never got to me. It was the blood. I didn't know before that first one so I did nothing to avoid it. The deep red oozed out of the empty neck. It looked like those berry pastries Mother always gets. I haven't eaten one since. Now, I try to look away.
</p>
<p>It's funny how the lifeless heads look after. It reminds me of unbaked dough. Soft and squishy, kneaded to your command. That's what I pretend they are.
</p>
<p>I think when I open up my own bakery I'll have a morning pastry called The Head of Dawn. It will be a soft, sweet dough, baked just til the crust begins to crisp. It will sit on a pool of thick blackberry sauce and I'll top it with the thinnest tendrils of sugar. It's inspired by fifty-six. I rarely know their real names. She was beautiful but charged for sorcery. When I heard the thud of my axe, I had to look. They say a sorceress's blood runs black. Hers was red.
