		<div id='text'><p><p>The door to the interrogation room clicked, then squeaked open. A smartly dressed detective entered the room, pausing to nod at the officer holding the door for her. She rested a briefcase on the interrogation table while the officer behind her entered the room and closed the door. The detective took a seat at the table and focused on the man seated across from her.
</p>
<p>“Your buddy Chris rolled on you, Anthony.”
</p>
<p>Anthony snorted. “Yeah, right.” <em>Were these losers really going to try that routine? </em>
</p>
<p>“He can put you at the scene and he’s willing to testify that you threatened Mr. Davidson.”
</p>
<p>“Man, you ain’t got shit. Chris don’t snitch.”
</p>
<p>Anthony could see the detective’s confidence wavering. She was already sweating. He knew Chris wouldn’t testify against him. There was clearly no real evidence.
</p>
<p>“Look Anthony, we’re trying to help you. We can get you a lighter sentence if you help us out on this. But if you don’t give us anything then we have to treat you as the primary suspect in Mr. Davidson’s murder.”
</p>
<p>The other officer crossed his arms and shifted slightly, still standing by the door. Something about him was odd. Usually detectives came in pairs but this time it was a detective and a regular patrol officer—complete with a peaked cap and dark aviator sunglasses.
</p>
<p>“Fuck you. You can’t prove shit. If you got evidence on me then prosecute, bitch.”
</p>
<p>The detective looked back at the officer and nodded solemnly. The officer reached up behind the camera directly above him and flicked a switch, causing the camera’s red recording light to wane and disappear. A look of concern flashed across Anthony’s face.
</p>
<p>“Hey, what the fuck are you doing?” he growled.
</p>
<p>“We tried to do this the easy way. You didn’t play along. Now we’re doing it the hard way.”
</p>
<p>Something about how the officer had emphasized “hard” in that sentence just didn’t sit right with Anthony. He looked back at the detective across from him and watched in confusion as she calmly stood up from her seat, moved her chair out of the way, and slid the interrogation table back. The patrol officer walked forward and stood directly in front of him.
</p>
<p>“You motherfuckers won’t get away with...” Anthony started to say, but he was interrupted by the officer’s index finger pressing down on his lips, shushing him. Anthony shrank away from the gesture. The officer proceeded to remove his cap and, confoundingly, place it on Anthony’s head. Unlike a normal police officer’s cap, this one seemed to be made of cheap plastic.
</p>
<p>“What the fuck is going on?” Anthony looked rapidly between the detective and the officer, wanting them to just yell at him like he had been expecting. The detective opened her briefcase, produced a small portable music player, and placed it on the interrogation table. She fiddled with it briefly and then it started playing music. Anthony recognized his exgirlfriend’s favorite song; Pony, by Ginuwine.
</p>
<p>The patrol officer’s hips began to gyrate. He looked Anthony dead in the eyes and started unbuttoning his collared uniform shirt. When he reached the last button he threw the shirt backward and pushed his bare, oily chest forward in time with the music. Anthony gave the detective a pleading look. She shrugged back. The officer ran a hand down his chest, cupped his crotch, and made some thrusting motions. The detective smiled and started flicking the light switch on and off with the beat.
</p>
<p>“Fuck man... fuck this. You don’t... have to do this.” Anthony mumbled, somewhat distracted by the striptease unfolding before him.
</p>
<p>The officer turned around, unbuttoned his pants, and pulled them down; revealing a navy blue thong.
</p>
<p>“Oh Jesus…” Anthony’s face twisted into a panicked grimace.
</p>
<p>The officer turned back to face his suspect. A shining gold police badge hung on the front of his thong. He approached Anthony and began circling him; walking in time with the music.
</p>
<p>“You’ve been a naughty boy, Anthony.”
</p>
<p>“Yo man, why’s it gotta be a dude?” Anthony blubbered, trying not to look at the police badge. “I’ll tell you who did it! Just don’t...  just... fuck...”
</p>
<p>The officer danced in front of his suspect and slowly straddled him; hips still gyrating in time with the music. The police badge dangled millimeters above Anthony’s lap as the officer began his lapdance. Anthony tried to look at the ceiling to avoid making eye contact with the officer, but the badge was too distracting. He couldn’t look away.
</p>
<p>“Fuck! ...okay! I… fucking shot that asshole!”
</p>
<p>The detective walked up and handed Anthony a clipboard and a pen to sign his confession. The patrol officer continued grinding until he made his signature. As Anthony was escorted out of the room, the detective handed the officer a towel.
</p>
<p>“Thanks for coming in Sebastian. That old ‘Good Cop, Stripper Cop’ routine gets ‘em every time.”
