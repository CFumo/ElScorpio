		<div id='text'><p><p>...we began to develop the capacity for rational thought roughly fifty thousand generations ago. At first we were foolish and blind. We destroyed each other and built dogmatic belief systems to justify it. We created and erased entire cultures with little regard. We lusted after natural resources and consumed them indiscriminately. We grew and grew until our needs outstripped the world’s ability to provide for us. We stagnated. We starved.
</p>
<p>Eventually we discovered science. We learned to hypothesize and test rather than guess and believe. We opened our eyes to the world around us, and in so doing we saw it in a new light. We saw a world that is as alive as we are. We saw complex processes that reacted to our inputs; albeit at a vastly slower rate. We learned that our unchecked growth had hurt the world and that there was no undoing past mistakes. Instead, we learned to help our world heal and grow and regain its former abundance.
</p>
<p>Nine generations ago we made a discovery. We realized that our world isn’t just alive; it is sentient. It has been attempting to communicate with us for thousands of generations. It was just too slow for us to notice. It took us four generations to decode the message our world sent us and another five to learn how to respond. It is a form of communication entirely, fundamentally baffling to us. Yet it is definitely a language and its intention is clear; to make contact. To learn from one another. Finally, after ages of searching for our purpose, we have an answer. Our world created us. It wishes to speak; to learn about us and about itself. Of course our world operates much slower than we do. Our dialog will last millennia. So we have chosen our words carefully. We will begin by transmitting our cultural iconography—our art—in the language of our creator...
