		<div id='text'><p><p>Dear bird fans,
</p>
<p>Sorry to burst your bubble, but sparrows are not real. We made them. Who is we? Pretty much anyone with a penchant for puzzles, a soldering iron, and a few bucks to spend on materials.
</p>
<p>Actually, wait. I don’t meant they’re NOT REAL. That’s dumb. Sparrows are real, but they’re just not natural.
</p>
<p>And I guess that’s also a gross overstatement. The HOUSE sparrow isn’t natural (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_sparrow).
</p>
<p>The thing is, a whole bunch of people just make them for fun. Kind of like a cross between electronics nerds and those people that make paper cranes for… sinning? I don’t know why people make paper cranes. Origami is weird. Rather, I should say that it’s not my cup of tea is all. I find it boring.
</p>
<p>Anyway, yeah. I think the practice of making sparrows came about a few hundred years ago or something. Those were a little more interesting because all the makers were pretty disparate and there was no spec that they followed. Even ones that came out waaay after we had the “best practices” books published worldwide were often off-spec. Not a big deal, of course. It’s actually kind of fun to find a sparrow with a mismatched set of op-amps for the wing beater units. One time I saw a REALLY cool one- probably built before the 20th century. It had a really awesome clock spring that auto-tightened when wind passed over the top of the wings. That’s how it survived for so long.
</p>
<p>Sorry- got a little off-track. I get excited by some of the finds!
</p>
<p>So, the whole conspiracy of this was pretty much a joke. The original guys (and girl! One of the founders was a girl!) had an inside joke, apparently. They were certain people would see the fake birds and freak out, but they pretended to be really secretive about it. A few months after the first sparrows were made and released, and after hundreds of them made it out to the Middle Eastern cities, the creators were totally floored by the lack of public outrage/fear/ANY response. Some DID take notice, but they were more keen on making more of the mechanical buggers, rather than make a fuss about putting on a large prank. By the turn of the 18th century, most developed nations had a local group of hobbyists that made these things.
</p>
<p>Things really changed when electronics became ubiquitous. It became really easy to make a whole drove of sparrows in a week for a single person. Some say that the craft of birdmaking really died there, as the outer shells were no longer made by the hobbyists, but bought as kits from cheap manufacturers (usually from China). I don’t think it’s a big deal, to be honest. Sure, the plumage isn’t as unique as it used to be from bird to bird, but it’s kind of nice to know that there’s a global collective that spends time working on a unified hobby!
</p>
<p>So, why I am writing this? It’s because we had SparrowCon 2016 recently and, as Head of the Social Impact group, I thought it’d be kinda cool to expand this hobby out to the rest of the bird community!
</p>
<p>I know some birders are gonna be a little mad about our endeavors, but I bet most will get over their embarrassment at being tricked into thinking that house sparrows are actual birds and be supportive of our fandom.
</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!
