		<div id='text'><p><p>I was hot and getting thirsty and flies kept landing on my shoulder. Garrett was ahead of me, full of energy as usual. When he first proposed a hike, I was excited. I hadn't seen him since he'd gotten married; it was no secret Maureen didn't like me.
</p>
<p>As if on cue, he shouted, "Come on, Stella! I told Maureen I was golfing with the boys today. We can't take all day."
</p>
<p>I quickened my pace to catch up to him. I could see his familiar smirk, the one I'd known my whole life.
</p>
<p>He helped me as it got steeper, guiding me down the rocky path. I liked how I never had to ask. He knew my fears, my passions, and maybe even my dreams. It's why, even after he was married, Garrett was still The One.
</p>
<p>He chattered on about work and family. I loved listening to him. The way his brows furrowed when he talked about his dad. How his voice softened as he recounted stories of his sister. "She misses you," he said. I missed her too.
</p>
<p>The speck of light in the distance grew until it opened into a clearing. I turned to him. Clearings were Our Thing. Here? I wondered.
</p>
<p>"Here," he replied. Garrett walked towards me then took my face in his hands. "It's been too long," he sighed. He peeled off his shirt, damp with sweat.
</p>
<p>I could feel nervous butterflies turning my stomach over. It had been awhile since the last time and I worried I'd forget what to do. It will be just like old times, I told myself. I faced him. It was obvious he was ready and I was full of equal desire.
</p>
<p>---
</p>
<p>The sky had started to turn pink when Garrett decided it was time to go. He ran his hands through my hair. "I've missed this," he whispered. I nodded, too spent to reply.
</p>
<p>We were quiet on the way back. I wondered if he was worried. We'd been gone longer than your average golf game. Maureen might get suspicious. I hoped he wouldn't give in and tell her. He'd kept our rendezvous secret while they were dating, though they became less frequent through the engagement.
</p>
<p>Garrett pulled up to my place and walked me to the door. He kissed my nose. I sighed. Who knew when we'd see each other again?
</p>
<p>"How'd it go?" I hadn't noticed Tim in the shadows.
</p>
<p>"It was great. Thanks for letting me take her out." Garrett shook his hand.
</p>
<p>Tim laughed. "She's your horse!"
</p>
<p>"That's not how it's supposed to work. I gave her to you."
</p>
<p>"Doesn't matter. She won't let anyone else ride her."
</p>
<p>Garrett chuckled and stroked my head. "Oh Stella, what are we going to do with you?"
