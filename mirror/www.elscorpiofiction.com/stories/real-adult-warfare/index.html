		<div id='text'><p><p>“So this is your first real action huh,” Sergeant Howell yelled over the roar of the LAV-25’s overworked diesel engine. Private Stevens nodded and tried to wipe the sweat from his brow, but the APC was bouncing around too much and his palm was sweatier than his face. Howell grinned and punched him in the shoulder.
</p>
<p>“Just don’t get distracted shitting yourself. Follow me and don’t fucking shoot me.”
</p>
<p>“Better to shit yourself than accidentally kill a friendly,” Corporal Freeman quipped, buckling his chinstrap as if the APC wasn’t even bouncing.
</p>
<p>“Thirty Seconds!” yelled the copilot, flicking a switch on the ceiling of the cockpit. He turned to look at something outside the vehicle and then flinched and yelled “Fuck, RPG!”
</p>
<p>The personnel carrier lurched to the left and rolled over, sending its crew and an assortment of gear bouncing in every direction inside the cabin. Emergency lighting flicked on and bathed the debris and limp soldiers in a deep bloody red.
</p>
<p>“Casualty report!” Sergeant Howell barked from somewhere inside the upside-down crew compartment.
</p>
<p>“I’m good!” yelled Corporal Freeman, inspecting the blood on his fingers after wiping his forehead. “Boyd, Myers, and the Rookie look combat ready too.”
</p>
<p>“I think me and Pork are dead,” said the copilot. “You better ditch us.”
</p>
<p>Howell climbed over to the exit hatch and kicked a pile of combat gear out of the way. “Alright boys, no time for a speech,” she said, opening the hatch and pointing her right index finger toward it as if she were holding a gun. “Let’s find some new cover. Get ready to be shot at.”
</p>
<p>Stevens followed Boyd and Freeman out of the hatch and into the blindingly bright desert sunlight. As soon as they left the shade of the overturned APC Boyd twitched and dropped limply to the ground. Stevens bent down to help but Howell grabbed him by the uniform and shoved him forward.
</p>
<p>“Headshot. Boyd’s already dead,” she yelled, pointing her gun-finger down the road in the direction of the incoming fire.
</p>
<p>“Bang Bang Bang!” Yelled Freeman, crouching next to a wall and pointing both fingers down the road. Stevens looked in the direction Freeman was pointing and saw a man hit the ground in a cloud of dust.
</p>
<p>“Ratatat!” yelled Myers, holding his fingers over the overturned APC and unleashing a barrage of suppressive fire.
</p>
<p>“Where’s that RPG?” Yelled Howell. Freeman pointed to a rooftop across the street, where a man in brown camouflage stood holding a cardboard tube.
</p>
<p>“PSHEW,” said the man, pointing his cardboard tube at Myers.
</p>
<p>Myers covered his ears, made an explosion sound, and threw himself onto the ground beside Boyd’s body, kicking sand and and rocks everywhere. He waited for a moment and then got up and started running toward the rest of the squad on the side of the road.
</p>
<p>“Wait wait, T/O!” Yelled the man on the rooftop. “I totally blew you up! You’re dead man!”
</p>
<p>“No way, I jumped out of the way just in time,” said Myers.
</p>
<p>“Yeah, he definitely escaped,” said Freeman, wiping his bloody forehead again.
</p>
<p>Some of the men from the other end of the road were shouting something, but Stevens couldn’t make it out.
</p>
<p>The man on the rooftop threw his arms in the air. “Dude, an RPG has like a 100ft kill range! You can’t just jump away from it!”
</p>
<p>Boyd rolled onto his back. “I think if you’re prone at this distance you could live through it, but it’d be lucky.”
</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s say Myers doesn’t make it but we get to take out the RPG,” said Howell. “Is that fair?”
</p>
<p>The man on the rooftop lowered his hands and nodded. “Fine, I’m pretty exposed anyway. You probably would’ve got me. TIME IN!” he said, hopping down to a balcony.
</p>
<p>Howell, Freeman, and Stevens huddled behind the wall. Howell peaked around the corner and cursed under her breath.
</p>
<p>“Alright, here’s the deal. We’re running low on ammo and there’s a technical at the end of the street, but our radio was in the LAV and it got blown up so we can’t call in air support.”
</p>
<p>The sergeant brandished a papier-mâché hand grenade from her breast pocket.
</p>
<p>“We’re gonna have to set up some traps in one of these buildings and hold them off until nightfall...”
