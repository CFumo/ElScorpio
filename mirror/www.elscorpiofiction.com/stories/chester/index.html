		<div id='text'><p><p>All unicorns are inherently gentle and would never dream of impaling a man with his horn and stomping his head like a melon. Except this one. Chester the Unicorn loved carnage—for Justice—and for months he'd been applying for a job as a police horse. They kept sending mystifying rejection letters stating that the police department didn't consider egg-laying applicants. It turned out a clerk in admissions was mixing up the words "unicorn" and "monotreme."
</p>
<p>"Same horn, same hole, same difference."
</p>
<p>"Fuck you asshole," said Chester, pointing a gun at the clerk over the counter. He had to hold the gun in his mouth, so it sounded like "huck you ashhole."
</p>
<p>The clerk held up his hands, and said drily, "I hear the circus is in town, why don't you try applying these?" He was calling Chester's bluff. Chester couldn't actually pull the trigger. He stamped his hooves in frustration and galloped out.
</p>
<p>But eventually Chester did apply for a job at the circus, as a show pony. The ringleader was a sleazy, corpulent man who smoked expensive cigars. Chester quickly discovered that the whole operation was a front for the man's human trafficking business, and confronted him one night in his office—a trailer round back of the tent. When the man tried to flee, Chester rammed him through the chest with his horn.
</p>
<p>"Justice prevails, motherfucker!"
