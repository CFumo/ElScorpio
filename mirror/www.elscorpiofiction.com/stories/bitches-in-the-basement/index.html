		<div id='text'><p><p>Andrea went to hang out with her friends Kim and Brittney, and when she got there their housemate Kya told her they were down in the basement-garage, "tinkering away." She found them hunched over an array of scattered tubes and bent metal plating; they seemed to be assembling a large machine in the middle of the concrete floor. Brittney, wearing sunglasses and a bandana over her mouth, was carefully soldering a small circuit board. Kim was surrounded by technical manuals and loose papers, sipping a canned Coors and peering at an article from an inscrutable physics journal. This was not exactly an unusual sight, but they seemed to be working with more excitement and urgency than normal.
</p>
<p>"So…this is supposed to be a 'time machine'?" asked Andrea with unmasked skepticism.
</p>
<p>"This is <em>actually </em>a time machine," Brittney corrected. "And don't give me that look. Like I said, we already know it works because we got a visit from future-me yesterday."
</p>
<p>"And she gave you the…plans for the time machine?"
</p>
<p>"No, I had the design sketched out weeks ago," said Kim. She handed a can of beer to Andrea, who opened her hand automatically to accept it. "She just came back to show us it'll work, and to tell us to hurry the fuck up. Britt, you wanna test the steam-release one more time?"
</p>
<p>"Why not, my perm is already fucked," said Brittney.
</p>
<p>"But why—" said Andrea, "and this is assuming you guys aren't just blazed out of your minds—but why is it so important for you guys to build this thing? I mean, important enough for you to visit your past self? Isn't that like…risky? Uh, theoretically?"
</p>
<p>Kim grinned. "Because apparently in like 400 years I become some kind of bad bitch super villain"—Kim and Brittney high-fived over the time machine—"and we need to finish the time machine so we can go to the future and help future-Britt stop me from taking over the world."
</p>
<p>"What the fuck…" said Andrea. "So why didn't future-Britt just, you know…stop you now?"
</p>
<p>"Ah," said Brittney. "So I guess how this works is, just talking is usually fine, but at the point of actually killing people, that's when time paradoxes start to crop up. Also Kim allegedly invents some other cool crap along the way, so she has to be at large long enough to—" She broke off with a laugh. "Shit. AutoCAD crashed my fucking laptop again."
</p>
<p>"Anyway," said Kim, "we're pretty much just fast-tracking this thing so we can go hang out with our badass future selves, basically."
</p>
<p>"Even though you're like, evil?"
</p>
<p>"Hell yeah. God I love future me…"
</p>
<p>"Ok well," said Andrea, "I'll leave you ladies to it then."
</p>
<p>"Well…" said Kim. "You probably better just stick around."
</p>
<p>"Why?"
</p>
<p>Kim and Brittney exchanged a glance over the time machine.
</p>
<p>"Because you come with us. To the future."
</p>
<p>"What? Oh, no. <em>Fuck </em>no."
</p>
<p>"Can't fight your fate, Dre," said Brittney, cracking open a beer.
</p>
<p>"Oohhh no," said Andrea, "there is no way I'm getting roped into this." This was too big for her. <em>Time </em>travel? And what were they supposed to do with future-Kim when they got there? Apprehend her? <em>Kill </em>her? Win her over with the power of friendship?
</p>
<p>And what about future-Andrea? What was her place in all this?
</p>
<p>Andrea stormed out of the basement-garage, unsure of the point of her anger, and already feeling the lure of the future.
