		<div id='text'><p><p>Dr. Wilson sat in his office pouring over a stack of midterms on a warm Sunday evening. He took a moment to run his fingers over the bridge of his nose and let his mind wander. He would have preferred to pour his tea all over the midterms and walk out, but that wouldn’t go over so well with the tenure committee he was scheduled to see in a few weeks. He looked at the clock; 7:06pm. He was beginning to convince himself to take a break and pick up some dinner when his thoughts were cut short by the screaming hell-portal that replaced his office door.
</p>
<p>The doctor watched in awe as a bleeding, howling conflagration erupted from his wall like some kind of flesh parasite burrowing out of its host. There was a noise coming from the portal; a sickening buzzing sound, as if the air was heavy with flies and mosquitoes. And there was screaming. Disjointed wails of thousands upon thousands of tortured souls. It was like a choral arrangement for the damned. He could see through the portal to a flaming, rotting nightmare plane in which the dead were condemned to eons of torment. Black smoke and embers billowed out and clouded the low office ceiling. The wall around the portal pulsated like a carcass crowded with maggots. The smell of the dead saturated every corner of the room. Dr. Wilson collapsed to his hands and knees and regurgitated a mass of black bile. It burned his throat and eyes. He wiped his face and discovered that his nose, or maybe his brain, was hemorrhaging profusely.
</p>
<p>A ghostly figure emerged from the midst of the unholy mayhem and floated through the portal. Dr. Wilson knew immediately, without even making eye contact, that he was in the presence of The Dark Lord Satan. The creature opened its mouth to speak and at that moment the whole world seemed to become silent in anticipation.
</p>
<p>“Hey, you’re like, a paleontologist or whatever, right?” it said, in the abyssal voice of misery incarnate.
</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson spent ten minutes crying before formulating a response. “Uhm… yes?” he whimpered, staring at the floor and barely holding back more vomit.
</p>
<p>“Oh that’s rad, bro!”, said Mephistopheles; The Prince of Darkness, as it snaked forth a vile decomposing fist. Dr. Wilson looked up and stared blankly at the Antichrist for a moment. It lowered its hand awkwardly in a manner that vaguely resembled self-consciousness.
</p>
<p>After another uncomfortable pause—during which Dr. Wilson quietly wept, and Beelzebub looked stiffly around the room pretending not to notice—the doctor worked up enough courage to ask why the Great Archfiend had chosen to visit <em>him</em>.
</p>
<p>“Okay, this is gonna be kinda weird. You mind if I hit this shit while we talk?”
</p>
<p>Lucifer, The King of Demons, raised a large, expertly rolled joint in one hand. Without waiting for an answer the Great Emperor of Malevolence took a seat in a nearby office chair and proceeded to light the reefer with a fiery lick from its tongue. The nightmare portal began screaming and disintegrated, leaving a putrid burning hole in Dr. Wilson’s wall. The doctor choked out another pile of steaming black mucus and stood up to face the Great Evil One. He belatedly noticed that the abomination which had entered his office looked mostly like a human and was wearing simple cargo shorts, flip flops, and a weathered grey hoodie. It was oddly casual attire for the literal embodiment of evil. Dr. Wilson wondered if perhaps it was discriminatory to assume that an archdemon of Hell would dress any differently than he. The creature took a large drag of smoke into its infernal lungs, waited about thirty seconds, and exhaled sharply with a look of macabre pleasure.
</p>
<p>“So I’m not, like, part of time, or whatever. All of the past and even the future, man, are just like, the same… thing for me.”
</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson continued staring at his guest. He rubbed his nose and unknowingly smeared blood across his face. The Shaitan tried to contain a laugh behind its withered claw and snorted audibly. It toked up again.
</p>
<p>“Truthfully, the dinosaurs are totally fake. Hah! But...” The Hell Master paused for an inordinate amount of time, staring at nothing in particular.
</p>
<p>“...But it wasn’t <em>originally </em>my idea. I actually got it from the Christians! The thing is, in my… uh… time, I haven’t actually placed the dinosaur bones yet. I’m supposed to go back and do that by the end of the day today, I guess. Hey, do you want a toke?”
</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson declined and motioned for The Supreme Antagonist to continue telling its paradoxical story, which was put on hold for a few minutes while the monster convulsed with laughter because Dr. Wilson looked “like a dad.”
</p>
<p>“Hahahah, so uhh..  Basically I need, like, an expert… kinda guy... to show me how to put the dinosaur bones down so that they look all real and shit. Obviously I’d pay you or… something. We’ll figure that out later. What do you say, homie? Wanna time travel out this bitch?”
</p>
<p>The Devil had presented what sounded like a question, but Dr. Wilson felt overwhelmingly confident that he didn’t have a choice in the matter. He agreed to advise the Great Villain on the placement and morphology of believable prehistoric fossils. The Monstrosity helped Dr. Wilson gather some relevant materials for his work and then blasted open a new portal in the doctor’s wall. Dr. Wilson took one final rueful look around his office—now covered in blood, bile, and various scorch marks—and then followed his new employer through the portal.
