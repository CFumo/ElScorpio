		<div id='text'><p><p>"Yeah this doesn't look good, Yrlene can you get Dr. Bishop in?"
</p>
<p>   "Hi it's Yrlene, we need you in- [...] Yeah, an extraction. [...] Yeah, about two weeks. [...] No, we haven't informed her. [...] We're way past that, Luke. We're keeping her under. [...] Patients are in room 505. [...] Yes Luke, we're way past... uh- [...] I don't know. Scott's scrubbing, he'll bring you up. [...] Okay, great. [...] Bye."
</p>
<p>"Scott?" "Yeah?" "I don't think I can stick around for this." "Is Dr. Bishop coming?" "He'll be in in ten." "Alright. You sure? We'll need someone to witness if... if... we don't..." "I just... I mean," Yrlene sighed. She had been through four deployments, taken fire providing first aid and handled thousands of major trauma cases. She should by all rights be able to face this. "Dammit, Scott." "Hm?" "Fuck." "It's alright if you-" "I'll stay." "Thank you," he mouthed.
</p>
<p>A torrent of eternal rain spit on the decrepid hospital. Its west wing had collapsed years ago, entombing thousands who had sought its shelter and aid. A lightless jeep slowly made its way down the hospital frontage road. Creatures closer to death than life attempted to follow.
</p>
<p>Dr. Bishop: Yes, my name is Lucas Bishop, pediatric physician at Chilton. I've been at the center since late 2016, so about five years. It's five years on the 15th, actually.
</p>
<p>Interviewer: So what was your experience with the first day?
</p>
<p>Dr. Bishop: Me, well, I was on vacation, I had been delaying it into fall due to the unusual, well, you know, circumstances-
</p>
<p>Interviewer: By circumstances, you mean, you mean what exactly?
</p>
<p>Dr. Bishop: Well, elevated patient count with many unusual cases. This was nothing extraordinary, so we weren't preparing for what would come by October. It was just unusual, you know. A little strange. Well, very strange for the time, but not compared... It was sad, of course. Delivering the news to so many parents is... it starts taking its toll, but it's, you still, you know. We started some small investigations when we saw the patient count was up three-fold in late June. Nothing connected the cases, all types were up the same. We checked the water, walls, air, anything that could make people so sick like that. But it seemed more kids were just getting sicker. Of course that couldn't be, and we now know, but what could we do except treat and hope? [...]
</p>
<p>Interviewer: But October comes up, and you're on vacation-
</p>
<p>Dr. Bishop: Yeah, we were in Milano on that day. I had, I had promised my wife we'd go. She understood, but three months, you know... and I could catch a break. We were nowhere closer, anyway. And whatever, the disease, well, the demons as you now know. It was global, basically. At the time I of course only knew about our local... uh, situation. I don't remember this kind of information being shared, it didn't look like an epidemic, just elevated. Cause for concern. Not... [...]
</p>
<p>Interviewer: How did you learn that the situation was so dire?
</p>
<p>Dr. Bishop: Dire... well, a chance meeting with an admin at the San Raffaele hospital. She overheard me complaining to my wife about work over breakfast at a café... uh, Trussardi, and we quickly found out we were dealing with the same problem.
</p>
<p>Interviewer: And this was the first time you heard of other communities dealing with this issue-
</p>
<p>Dr. Bishop: Really, I don't know why it took our chance meeting to notice a worldwide phenomenon. I was in daily contact with a team in Augusta, I could've... I don't know what. I could've asked them- [...]
</p>
<p>Interviewer: Asked what?
</p>
<p>Dr. Bishop: Right?
</p>
<p>Interviewer: I mean, what could you have asked them?
</p>
<p>Dr. Bishop: I'm sorry?
</p>
<p>Interviewer: So, you realize the scope of the problem when you meet with the administrator in Milano. Did this spur action on your part or anything like that-
</p>
<p>Dr. Bishop: Oh yeah, I had Adena call her staff at the CDC while I phoned my head. Uh, Dr. Adams, chair of pediatrics. But this was the last normal day. Even if we had realized the extent quicker, I don't know what we could have done.
</p>
<p>Lucas darted in, leaving the jeep idling. "Are we ready?" he panted at Scott. "Yes, scrub in," Scott said swinging a scalpel at the slapdash scrub station. "There's time?" "Yeah, uh, let's at least maintain a level of-" A torrent of water bashed the metal sink as Lucas scrubbed to a level. Yrlene noted the time: Midnight. "Go!" Luke yipped and kicked up the door to room 505.
</p>
<p>"Non volebat praesentius tua!" Scott shouted running into the cold room, holding up a scalpel threatening the parturient patient. The pale woman slowly moved her head to face Scott, eyes closed. She panted, slowly animating as the room grew smaller and colder. "Speak English you fucking faggot," she growled. Luke rolled his eyes. Scott shot Luke a look. The procedure required them to maintain stern professionality as the demon was abated and, all going well, sent back to his place. Only then could delivery be performed successfully.
</p>
<p>Scott held the scalpel aloft again and shouted with all his vocal strength, "Non volebat praesentius tua!" She shrieked until a shrill cough developed. Bile let out of a corner of her mouth and an acrylic stench made up. "You faggy fucking fag fuck, just speak fucking English," she at last requested. She gasped and retched as she opened her bloodshot eyes, staring blankly through Luke. "Puer autem nostrum!" Scott yelled. "No it is not!" the demon rasped. "The child is none and nothing anymore, it belongs to nobody, it is void and dead! Eternal oblivion awaits all! Hell? Hahaha! Nothing! Eternal oblivion! Fools! Fools hahahahaHAHAHAHAHA!" Thunder cracked as she cackled. Luke, tired of the theatrics, this war, life, death, the roaming ones, these creatures, interjected, "No, it is not, it's still alive. That child will be delivered. What is it you want? You want to stop us? For all we know, this might be one of the last children on Earth. You want to kill us? Try it! What the fuck do you want?" Scott was dismayed. Dr. Bishop knew full well this was not allowed under any circumstance. It never was and never will- well- it never was, especially not now. "Just," Scott stared into space, "just ignore him."
</p>
<p>The demon paused, pondering the development. How cruel is fate. After many desperate years of taking hosts of their innocents, until the last one, they were finally speaking their own language. The last viable channel into worldly Creation, now they speak. Dialogue might at last be possible. Perhaps there was hope for the worlds.
</p>
<p>"Lock her up," she said simply and disappeared from the realm.
