		<div id='text'><p><p>It was christmas morning at Santa’s workshop, and a sullen gloom lay heavily in the air. The usual din of christmas bells and elf chatter was gone, replaced by a hollow silence and the sour scent of the freshly deceased which wafted out from various cabins and huts scattered around the property. The sound of a gunshot echoed momentarily through the courtyard, and then silence swept back in and blanketed everything.
</p>
<p>Snowball lowered his gun. Bits of blood and brain wept down along the wall in front of him. It was done, and there was no time to mourn. The vile book already lay on Clementine’s bed, though Snowball couldn’t remember putting it there. The thing reeked of death and rot, even more than before. He opened it and frantically combed through its pages, knowing that the book would not let him find the page he wanted until he was sufficiently nauseated by its crawling depictions of hell and ritual sacrifice. He wondered if the book was aware of him, if it knew how much its nightmares were already corroded into his brain.
</p>
<p>“Stop,” said Clementine.
</p>
<p>Snowball looked up from the book. The elf’s corpse lay motionless on the bed beside him, staring at the ceiling. The blankets were soaked black with blood from the hole through its head. Maybe he was hearing things. He looked back at the book, which was now open to the page he had been looking for. The page that contained the ritual for summoning a demon.
</p>
<p>A raspy breathing noise drifted down into the fireplace. A quick glance was enough for Snowball to see that there was soot falling from somewhere higher up in the chimney. He could feel a sort of christmas darkness; a distorted version of the holiday spirit that he once felt when Santa Claus was near. He had seen what that creature did to Forrest and Sixpence. Telling Clementine that it “ate” them was the only language he could conjure to describe it. The reality was far worse. <em>It was worth shooting Clementine in the face to stop that thing. It was worth using the book.</em>
</p>
<p>The book’s ritual was vile in its simplicity. Snowball tore off Clementine’s clothing and dragged his corpse onto the ground beside the bed, posing it in a manner reminiscent of crucifixion. Straddling the corpse, he pulled a kitchen knife from the small of his back where it was hidden and—holding it with both hands—slowly pressed the tip of its blade into Clementine’s mouth. His friend’s lifeless eyes turned to meet his gaze. He pushed harder, until he could feel the knife sinking into the back of Clementine’s throat. The corpse glared at him. There was a scratching noise in the fireplace. He looked up and saw the beast’s head, inverted and peering into Clementine’s room, expressionless. It was the face of Santa Claus, but distorted and animalistic. It was covered in blood and it’s eyes were white and empty, like those of an exhumed body. Clementine’s corpse began to convulse. Pale green bile poured out of his mouth, covering his face and mixing with the bloody hole in his forehead. The smell made Snowball retch. The knife jerked out of his hands and disappeared deeper into Clementine’s throat. He stumbled back, overwhelmed by the smell and the violence and the eyes of his dead friend that wouldn’t stop staring at him. A rotting hand emerged from inside Clementine’s mouth and gripped his lower jaw as if to push it away. Another hand reached up from this space that shouldn’t exist and followed suit. Snowball’s stomach churned with fear and nausea as Clementine’s face slowly ripped open at the jaw and a humanoid demon crawled out of it, covered in blood and bile.
</p>
<p>The creature stood and looked around the room. A wet black cloak concealed most of its body, but its smouldering hair and tricorn hat were unmistakeable. Of course Hell would send Blackbeard to Santa’s Toyshop. It was, after all, the greatest treasure in the world.
</p>
<p>“Aye, what a curiously vile deed ye have done, elf,” spoke the demon, in a voice that reverberated inside Snowball’s head as clearly as his own thoughts. “What misery do you desire?”
</p>
<p>Snowball wiped the tears from his eyes and pointed toward the fireplace. “Kill that beast before it gets loose, and you can have the workshop.”
</p>
<p>“A fine trade ye offer. I accept.”
</p>
<p>Blackbeard grinned malevolently, his face brimming with rotten teeth. The beast that was once Santa Claus crawled out of the fireplace and nestled up to him, bending down to lick the viscera that remained of Clementine’s head.
</p>
<p>“I accept the workshop,” Blackbeard continued, “but I’d prefer to keep my cur.”
</p>
<p>Snowball stared in disbelief. Clementine’s body twitched.
</p>
<p>“Aye, I’ll keep the elves too. From this day forth, Christmas will involve stealing and murder. And the children of the world will have Christmas everyday.”
</p>
<p>Blackbeard gestured toward Clementine, whose headless body slowly stirred and began to stand up.
</p>
<p>“Ye’ve work to do, elves. I need a new ship.”
