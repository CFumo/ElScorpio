		<div id='text'><p><p>EXT. FOREST - DUSK
</p>
<p>EARNEST leans hard against a fallen tree, pushing his glasses up his beak. He is unfazed by the bullets passing overhead.
</p>
<p>EARNEST (grimacing) It’s too bloody cold out here for this.
</p>
<p>PANCHO Afraid your tailfeathers’ll freeze, Ernie
</p>
<p>PANCHO leans out from behind the tree and [shoots the bad guys a lot with a big gun].
</p>
<p>EARNEST It’s not my tailfeathers I’m worried about. And don’t call me Ernie.
</p>
<p>MAJOR AKINDELE (chewing his cigar in his beak) Will you jackasses knock it off. We have to save the president’s daughter. [kinda lame, fix -C]
</p>
<p>EARNEST walks out from behind cover- suit jacket blowing suavely in the wind. He takes aim at a long-haired foe and lands a wellplaced shot on the goon’s gun; pointing it in the direction of another metalhead. With a second shot EARNEST kills the first bad guy [meh -C], who then compulsively fires on his friend.
</p>
<p>ZOOM INTO DYING METALHEAD #2
</p>
<p>METALHEAD #2 (screaming, bleeding) My bleak existence is at its end. Take me down into the void, Father!
</p>
<p>The last of the goons breaks into a sprint away from the battle. Muscles bulging in his arms, MAJOR AKINDELE lifts his huge machine gun and opens fire on the metalhead. [he dies]
</p>
<p>MAJOR AKINDELE (smiling, chewing cigar) Tell Satan I’m coming for him next.
</p>
<p>OSTRICHES begin reloading their weapons. [badass exposition of guns]
</p>
<p>EARNEST Brilliant. So what’s our plan, Major?
</p>
<p>MAJOR AKINDELE I ain’t got time for plans.
</p>
<p>PANCHO (turning his fitted baseball cap backward) Chingada! This shit just got real.
</p>
<p>MAJOR AKINDELE chambers a round in his M60 and flicks his cigar butt into the snow. It goes out with a wet sizzle.
</p>
<p>EXT. SATANIC ALTAR - DUSK
</p>
<p>Snow is falling softly on the scene. SATANISLAUS BLOODSLAYER is busy tying the President’s daughter HEATHER to a sacrificial altar. An explosion rocks the trees nearby as three goons are sent flying into the brush. [more epic gunfight]
</p>
<p>METALHEAD The blood of dark gods flows through my veins, devils fly by my command.
</p>
<p>PANCHO kicks the soldier hard enough to kill him.
</p>
<p>PANCHO Whose head is in the sand now, bitch?
</p>
<p>SATANISLAUS (growling) They found me! [says something really metal]
</p>
<p>SATANISLAUS unties HEATHER at gunpoint and drags her to a waiting helicopter. The sound of the whirring helicopter blades drowns out everything but the gunfire.
</p>
<p>HEATHER Major!
</p>
<p>[He should say “God Damn Hoochie Mama!” here, but it sounds weird because it’s like he’s calling her that -R]
</p>
<p>MAJOR AKINDELE runs to catch the helicopter. He jumps and grabs the landing skid of the helicopter with his arm just as the helicopter starts flying away.
</p>
<p>AKINDELE and BLOODSLAYER fight on the helicopter, trade snappy one-liners
</p>
<p>PANCHO and EARNEST get in the second helicopter and give chase Gatling gun sky battle over a volcano AKINDELE kills BLOODSLAYER, puts on the emergency wingsuit and flies HEATHER down the side of the volcano
</p>
<p>They kiss as the volcano is erupting
</p>
<p>More grenades, more ostrich references
</p>
<p>Make it clearer that the bad guys are black metal guys
</p>
<p>Where’s the corpse paint
</p></p></div>
