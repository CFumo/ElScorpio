		<div id='text'><p><p>Midway through their fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry, Ron, and Hermione Granger learn that they can buy weed from Hagrid. He introduces them to his finest magical strain and shortly thereafter the trio spends nearly five hours listening to Hagrid’s favorite bootleg Black Sabbath vinyl. Over the weeks their attendance begins to falter as they descend into a ganjah-induced malaise. Lazy weekend afternoons turn into lazy weekends and then into whole weeks of truancy.
</p>
<p>Voldemort hears of Harry’s newfound pastime and, realizing that the adolescent boy poses no threat to him and his Death Eater cronies, quickly overcomes his manic obsession with the Potter family. After learning of the world-changing power of the internet and big data, he decides to recruit all of the students of Slytherin into a data-mining startup.
</p>
<p>Sixteen year old Ron and Harry, fully invested in their new stoner lifestyle, start a garage band. It doesn’t really go anywhere. Hermione realizes that her stoner friends are dragging her down and stops associating with them. She transfers to Ravenclaw. After agonizing for months Ron decides to leave Hogwarts and apply to a vocational school for IT because, like the rest of the Hogwarts students, he has spent too many years away from the normal education system and no one will hire him.
</p>
<p>A year later Harry contracts Hepatitis B from a girl who claims to have fallen in love with him and his band. She promptly leaves him for Malfoy. Despite his best magical efforts Harry is unable to cure his newfound disease. He refuses to ask Hermione for help out of shame. He carries on a series of unfulfilling relationships before he realizes that he has been in love with Ron all along. Sadly, Ron is homophobic.
</p>
<p>Nobody kills Dumbledore; he just dies because he’s really old.
