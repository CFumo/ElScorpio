</p>
<p>A distraught and a little confused news anchor appeared on screen. "Okay, we have these images of the Moon. So, I guess they are real. I.. The face of the moon has been defaced with one of these..." "Memes," could be heard off-screen. "I don't understand. Johnny did Mel put you up to this?" A simple "No," came from off-screen.
</p>
<p>A picture of the Moon appeared, defaced with an image of Dick Butt, an Internet sensation from the late 00s. "These are supposedly, I mean, I.. is the Moon visible from here? Listen, we're going to bring our cameras and take a look..." Another picture of the defaced Moon faded in on-screen. "This one was just submitted... from..." [...] "From the area." [...] "This is ridiculous." [...] "Is there.. a, claim, to, responsibility?" the anchor asked flustered. A slideshow of photos showing the defaced Moon ran silently until interrupted by a live feed of it. The camera struggled to keep focus on the defaced Moon rising above the Toronto skyline. "Oh my God. Who did this?"

<p>"So you're telling me that Brooklyn freak used a giant laser to carve that freakish cartoon on it?" the President asked an intelligence officer.
</p>
<p>"Absolutely," he answered.
</p>
<p>"Why hasn't he been hanged already?"
</p>
<p>"We just wanted to let you know first."

<p><strong>Dr. Brooklyn Maintains Innocence</strong>
</p>
<p>The Moon defaced this morning has many questioning the purpose of Dr. Brooklyn's Giant Laser project and its intended purpose. In response the Institute of Reasearch and Such has published a short memorandum: "The Giant Laser at the Institute of Research and Such is only intended to be used for peaceful purposes. The IRS would never use a giant laser to carve a giant 'dickbutt' graphic into the Moon just to deface it. Of course we deny all involvement in this and condemn this act."
