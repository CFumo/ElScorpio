		<div id='text'><p><p>The air hung thick with the dangerous hum of silence. Streets crossed and neon trams glided by in an easy rhythm. Each block was crowded to the tooth with yawning skyscrapers, each window patterned the purple-gray sky in a quilted patchwork of light. And on every building were security cameras, perched like vultures. And there was one particular video camera on one particular building that peered directly into the office of one Graham P. Whitaker, PhD.
</p>
<p>There were years and years of footage from this camera backlogged. The room was almost always empty except for the rare occasions when Dr. Whitaker could be seen rummaging through the heavy drawers of his mahogany desk or sitting bent over near a pile of paper that flirted with the ceiling. The only other items on the desk were a stapler and a collection of animal-shaped paperweights. A dog. A horse. A cat. A frog. And an elephant. These Dr. Whitaker rearranged every now and then, but for the most part they collected dust. Years and years of video footage of this room. And absolutely nothing useful. Until tonight.
</p>
<p>At 03:11:05 a figure entered the frame of the office window. A figure unknown, of slender frame silhouetted by the bright lamp atop the mahogany desk. As programmed, the camera lens zoomed in to view the uncustomary activity. High resolution made out the sloped shoulders, tight gait, and bobbed hair of an older woman - between 27 and 28. Her movements were robotic, as if her brain's signals to the rest of her body were being carried by carrier pigeon. Red ringed her eyes and the skin above her lips was cracked. She opened one drawer. Closed it. Opened another drawer. Closed it. Crawled under the desk. Stood up. Paced around the desk. Left the view of the window for five minutes and came back with a stack of papers with chicken scratch all over them. Then she sat for an eternity and read. And read. And read.
</p>
<p>The woman fell asleep, her head on the desk, after getting through over half of the pile. She woke up and reached into her pocket. She pulled out a crumpled piece of paper that had been mulled over with her hands a million times and was now soft as cotton. She read it. And as she read, she stopped breathing in. Her hands started to shake. Then her whole body rocked and swayed. She throttled her torso forward, doubled over, and began to weep. Terrible, wracking sobs. Her hands balled into fists that struck her knees, then thrashed out across the desk - sending papers and paperweights flying. The lamp shattered.
</p>
<p>The light from the lamp now illuminated a far corner of the ceiling - the camera readjusted aperture to see into the darkened room. The woman was on the floor, grasping something violently in her palm. A dog. One of its legs broken off. And poking out from where his leg was - a USB drive. In a drunken rush, the woman gathered the papers scattered across the floor and ran out of the room, kicking the lamp on her exit, sending a helicopter of light spinning across the camera's view.
</p>
<p>The spinning came to a halt. Silence punctured the night again. A little red light blinkblinked on the security camera. Someone would be alerted of this soon. Someone would be very interested to find out who this woman was. And where she could be found.
