		<div id='text'><p><p>Samantha V: You sure you want to do this?
</p>
<p>Rachel O: Hells yea
</p>
<p>*RO pushes SV playfully and her hand touches SV’s boob.*
</p>
<p>SV: Hey! I said I wanted to touch yours first!
</p>
<p>RO: Too late, you dork
</p>
<p>*RO reaches for SV’s boobs again*
</p>
<p>*SV slaps the hand away and glomps RO*
</p>
<p>RO: Whoa! You said touch-
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>“Wait. This is your erotica story of us… what… cybering? Or actually doing it? ‘Boobs’? Are you six?”
</p>
<p>Samantha blushed. “Hey, this is just for fun. Just a story for the Valentine’s Day issue.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m not saying that it SUCKS. It’s fucking great. I love it and I’m just teasing... I guess I just don’t get the setting one hundred percent.”
</p>
<p>Rachel placated Sam. “I just don’t think that’s realistic.” Samantha shot Rachel a look. “What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>“Well…” She sat a little closer to her friend. “For one thing, I’d tell you something like ‘take off the sweatshirt’.”
</p>
<p>“Alright. I guess that’s unrealistic? But this is just-”
</p>
<p>“I said take off your sweatshirt.”
</p>
<p>“Oh- oh.” Reddening, Samantha slowly complied. “Ok. What- what would happen next?”
</p>
<p>Rachel grinned, “well, I’d lean in a little and tell you to kiss my neck.” She angled closer.
</p>
<p>Samantha gulped and moved in for Rachel’s barren throat.
</p>
<p>“Hey! I didn’t say to kiss my neck! I was saying what I WOULD say in a realistic encounter!”
</p>
<p>Sam jerked back, Rachel’s words shocking ice water. “Oh. Oh I’m- Oh boy. I was just-”
</p>
<p>Rachel keeled over with laughter. “Christ! I’m just fucking with you! Hahahahahaha! Oh man!”
</p>
<p>The look of incredulity slowly displaced by mild annoyance on Samantha’s face.
</p>
<p>“Goddamn it…” she croaked.
</p>
<p>“Ah hahahahahahah!” Rachel rocked too far in her episode and lay on the floor, covering her red face. “Your face! Oh man, that little lip quiver when you learned in was HILARIOUS!”
</p>
<p>Rachel felt Sam’s hands around her wrists. A moment later, they were pinned high above her to the floor.
</p>
<p>Still laughing, Rachel shifted fully to her back to get comfortable.  “Motherfucker,” Samantha said with a hint of mirth. She now held Rachel’s wrists in her left hand- still pinned high. A little forcefully, Sam slid her right hand to the back of Rachel’s neck. The incidental hair pulling forced a surprised exclamation from Rachel’s throat. The dominant woman shifted her weight on her knees, bent down, and kissed the other deeply. Lips first, but the two felt the gentle caresses of each others’ tongues. Ragged breathing punctuated by the popping sounds of kisses.
</p>
<p>Lifting Rachel’s neck, Sam went for the other’s throat, kissing and nipping Rachel’s lip, chin, and jaw on the way. Rachel, eyes closed, moaned lightly. Orally exploring the soft flesh of her friend, Samantha drew her right hand down, feeling the curve of breasts, stomach, hips. Her hand stopped at the dress hem and pressed firmly against the warmth.
</p>
<p>“Mmmhmmmm?” She hummed her question. “Mmmmmmm...hmmmmmmmmmm.” The drawn out response. Sam, still kissing and lightly sucking, deftly slid her hand under the dress and pulled the bottom of Rachel’s white, wet undies to the side.
</p>
<p>A quick, aggressive thrust of two fingers- she was deep inside. “Owwwhoaaaaaaaaa-” Rachel exclaimed, eyes wide. The instant of sharp pain gave way to a very deep, pleasant tug. “Wow, dude. That was- whoaaaaa-”
</p>
<p>She trailed off. The palm of Sam’s hand was firmly pressing against Rachel’s clit. The first orgasm wracked her body within a minute-
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>CF: Dude, are you serious?
</p>
<p>ZF: Yeah. What?
</p>
<p>CF: “First orgasm wracked her body within a minute.” It just sounds like a male-centric thing. The penetration-
</p>
<p>ZF: Ohhh, I see what you mean. Assuming that a woman needs a male role in her sex life.
</p>
<p>CF: A penetrative act.
</p>
<p>ZF: Right right. Yeah. I guess that’s true. I just have trouble writing a more holistic sex story- especially if there’s a word limit.
</p>
<p>CF: Holistic?
</p>
<p>ZF: Yeah. I think that’s the right word… It feels right… Lemme look it up… Comprehension… Interconnected and explicable… Whole.
</p>
<p>CF: Alright- I can see that. Maybe just leave it off with the foreplay?
</p>
<p>ZF: I could, but then that’s another story that ends like that. Just like A Knight to Forget.
</p>
<p>CF: Alright. Also, there’s the weird thing in the beginning. Not counting the meta-story.
</p>
<p>ZF: Oh? What do you mean?
</p>
<p>CF: Well… it just doesn’t sound realistic.
</p>
<p>ZF: What do you mean?
</p>
<p>CF: Well, if I wanted to seduce my friend, I’d say “touch me.”
</p>
<p>ZF: That’s an irrelevant detail, I think. I just picked some-
</p>
<p>CF: I said. Touch. Me.
</p>
<p>ZF: Oh- uh… Well… Alright.
</p>
<p>[ZF reaches over to CF’s arm]
</p>
<p>CF: No. My dick.
</p>
<p>[Hesitating for only a moment, ZF starts to move his hand to CF’s groin. CF doesn’t stop him.]
