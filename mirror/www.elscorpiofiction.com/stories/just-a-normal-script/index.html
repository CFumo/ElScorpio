</p>
<p>EXT. COZY, MODERN HOME - DUSK
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>CUT TO:
</p>
<p>INT. HOME, KITCHEN - DUSK, BUT WELL LIT INTERIOR
</p>
<p>ANDREW, small business owner and outdoor enthusiast, late 20s and fit, walks carefully from the KITCHEN to the LIVING ROOM, holding TWO MUGS OF STEAMING COCOA.
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>CUT TO:
</p>
<p>LIVING ROOM - SOFT, PLEASANT LIGHT
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>BECCA, musician and dancer with a small frame and a laugh-lined face, sits at a writing desk, hard at work. Her head resting on her non-dominant hand.
</p>
<p>Andrew walks to Becca’s side and carefully places a mug onto the desk.
</p>
<p>Becca stops writing, lifts the mug, and places it onto a ceramic coaster in one smooth action. She turns to Andrew and smiles.
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>BECCA
</p>
<p>Careful, hon. I don’t want to mark up the new table just yet.
</p>
<p>Andrew smiles back impishly and gently strokes Becca’s shoulder.
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>ANDREW
</p>
<p>Sorry. I keep forgetting, love.
</p>
<p>Andrew sets his own mug down on a second coaster and kisses Becca’s forehead.
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>ANDREW
</p>
<p>How’s the short story? Have you seen Jake?
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>BECCA
</p>
<p>I’m actually revising a song. I’m putting off the story until tomorrow.
</p>
<p>Becca turns to look out the window in front of her desk.
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>CUT TO:
</p>
<p>EXT. VIEW OF THE HOUSE'S BACK YARD FROM THE WINDOW - LATE DUSK
</p>
<p>JAKE, just an outline against the disappearing light, lying next to a tree. It appears that he is watching the moon and the faint stars.
</p>
<p>The reflection in the window shows Becca standing up and speaking after a beat.
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>BECCA
</p>
<p>There he is. Still out there.
</p>
<p>The reflection of Andrew moves closer to his wife.
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>CUT TO:
</p>
<p>LIVING ROOM, FROM THE ANGLE OF THE WINDOW
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>ANDREW
</p>
<p>Think we should call him in, love?
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>BECCA
</p>
<p>Nah. It’s warm out, and I know he took a sleeping bag out there with him. Maybe he’ll even catch a glimpse of the Perseid showers.
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>ANDREW
</p>
<p>It sure is a good evening to dream the dreams of our stars. May the wonder in his eyes be sated.
</p>
<p>Becca turns to Andrew with mischief in her eye and moves closer to her lover.
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>BECCA
</p>
<p>Nice prose, Shakespeare.
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>ANDREW (feigning hurt)
</p>
<p>I can’t help that you’d failed to teach me your ways, o’ Euripides.
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>BECCA
</p>
<p>You’re such a dork. (gives Andrew a peck on the cheek) Wanna finish the No Reservations episode?
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>ANDREW (over-excited)
</p>
<p>Yes! Take the hot choco. I’ll get the blankets. We can ALL be campers tonight.
</p>
<p>The two break apart and go along their way. Becca turns off a desk lamp and only the warm glow of a hearth fire provides an intimate light.
</p>
<p>FADE OUT:
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>FADE IN:
</p>
<p>INT. LIVING ROOM, SAME SHOT AS ABOVE - BRIGHT MORNING
</p>
<p>Becca shambles out of the kitchen with a MUG OF COFFEE. She walks toward the camera with a bedhead and a loose-fitting shirt.
</p>
<p>Becca stands at her desk and strains her eyes against the bright light.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, her eyes widen and she drops her coffee on the desk, splashing her work with a dark roast.
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>ANDREW (walking quickly over from the direction of the fire and TV)
</p>
<p>Babe? What’s up? Have an accident? Want me to get -- (as Becca is immobile, Andrew grows more concerned) Babe!? Becca? What’s wrong?
</p>
<p>Andrew comes to Becca, quite distressed. This is a man who clearly wants the best for his family. He checks his wife and after not seeing anything immediately threatening, picks up particularly sharp shards of ceramic from around Becca’s feet.
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>ANDREW (getting up and running a free hand along his wife’s side in support)
</p>
<p>What’s wrong, honey? You ok? Don’t step around, I think there are still sharp things around. (looks at Becca’s ashen face for a beat and follows her gaze) (MORE) ANDREW (CONT'D) Oh my God. (quietly) Oh my God. (louder) OH MY GOD JAKE (almost yelling)
</p>
<p>Andrew runs offscreen with a horrified expression.
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>ANDREW (his shrill voice fading with distance)
</p>
<p>oh my god oh my god oh fuck fuck oh god (etc)
</p>
<p>Becca, still staring ahead with a haunted look begins to shiver. Her eyes well up. She looks ten years older.
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>CUT TO:
</p>
<p>EXT. VIEW OF THE HOUSE'S BACK YARD FROM THE WINDOW - MORNING
</p>
<p>Jake is still in the same position he was before, but can now be seen clearly. Something is wrong, but the viewer can’t quite make it out.
</p>
<p>The CAMERA starts to move forward, through the glass and toward the boy.
</p>
<p>Jake is certainly unwell. His clothing looks torn and bloody. His head is somehow shaped wrong.
</p>
<p>CAMERA still moving closer.
</p>
<p>Jake’s body is undulating slightly- like a fast-motion video of a maggot-ridden carcass.
</p>
<p>CAMERA moves even closer.
</p>
<p>A DOOR SLAMS OPEN and Andrew can be heard sprinting and yelling.
</p>
<p>Jake’s flesh is pulsating and veiny. His extremities are somehow strange. They look flat and overly long.
</p>
<p>CAMERA moves closer still.
</p>
<p>Andrew, who is now assumed to be within a dozen feet of his son is no longer blabbering.
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>ANDREW
</p>
<p>Jake? Sport? Jake? (he gags) Christ… Jake… Jesus fucking Christ (visceral sounds of vomiting)
</p>
<p>The CAMERA stops moving as the scene of horror fills the screen. Jake’s body is more than mutilated- it’s ruined, wasted, spoiled. Whatever happened to him is not natural.
</p>
<p>Jake’s head is overstretched and sickly. Hemorrhaged tumors blemish his young features. His arms and legs seem to have been fused with the earth, which is slick with viscera and a foul jelly. The back of his head that leaned against the tree is stuck and molded to the bark.
</p>
<p>The corpse quivers anew. It’s apparent that something is forcing itself out of the boy.
</p>
<p>A thick boil bursts to reveal an eyestalk. A second later, dozens more push through the yielding flesh. They look aimlessly with new sight before reorienting in unison, like sunflowers, offscreen, and stare at Andrew.
</p>
<p>A piercing scream of abject terror can be heard from behind the camera. Becca’s scream.
