<p><em>"The More, The Merrier: Paddington Bear Explores Polylife" - Zhenya Frolov</em><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>One day Paddington awoke with a funny feeling. “Hmmm, I must be hungry,” he said, and headed downstairs for a bit of breakfast. He fixed himself a bear’s breakfast of bacon-marmalade sandwiches and tea with cream and two sugars. But after eating, he found he still had this funny feeling. After much pontification he had a thought, “perhaps all I needs is some fresh air and a long walk.” And with that he set out towards the centre of town.
</p>
<p>It wasn't long before he found himself in a place he had never been before. “Shoreditch,” read a nearby sign. “Oh my, what a curious place this ‘Shoreditch’ is, he thought as he walked past people with brightly colored hair, eclectic clothing, and piercings. It was all so wondrous but he soon felt exhausted and wanted to find a nice park in which to take a nap. Not knowing his way around he approached a table of people outside an artisanal, small batch, hand roasted, fair trade, <em>qahwah</em> shop. “Excuse me,” he asked, “can you ladies kindly point me to the nearest park?”
</p>
<p>“Sure, we’re actually heading there now if you’d like to join!”
</p>
<p>“Why yes, that would be lovely.”
</p>
<p>And with that they walked to the park and spent the entire day enjoying eachother's company. “Wow, I haven’t had such a fantastic day in quite some time!” exclaimed Paddington. “Me either,” the three girls said in unison, but suddenly they stopped smiling and their eyes looked almost sleepy.
</p>
<p>“You know, we all would love to see you again,” said the one named Claire.
</p>
<p>“I would too,” replied Paddington.
</p>
<p> “But which <em>one</em> of us do you want to see again?” asked Heather.
</p>
<p>“Which <em>one?</em>”
</p>
<p>“Yeah, you can only have one of us,” replied Heather.
</p>
<p>Paddington found this to be a very tough decision. After spending the day with them he found each to have their own unique enchantments. There was Heather with the delicious looking hair the color of honey, Claire who smelled like berries, and Simone, who knew just how to stroke his fur.
</p>
<p>“My,” said Paddington, “I’m afraid I’m having a very hard time with this decision. I don’t really want to pick just one of you ladies.”
</p>
<p>“Ok then don’t,” said Simone.
</p>
<p>“What?” said everyone.
</p>
<p>“There’s enough bear to go around. Why don’t we all just share?”
</p>
<p>“Well bears do have a big appetite,” thought Paddington. “Ok, let’s give it a try!
</p>
<p>“Excellent! I’ll take him on Friday nights,” said Simone with a coy smile.
</p>
<p>“I’ll have him on Saturday afternoons,” said Heather dreamily.
</p>
<p>“And I only need him every Thursday after work,” said Claire with a cheeky wink.
</p>
<p>All week Paddington paced the house anxiously awaiting the start of this new experience until finally the night of his first date came. He met Heather at her house and they had a nice supper of honey sandwiches. “You know your golden hair looks just a tasty as this sandwich,” said Paddington. Heather stared deep into his eyes and said, “You like my honey colored hair, do you? Well what if I told you there’s an even sweeter nectar between my legs? Would it make you want to plunder my hive?” And the two of them retired to the bedroom.
</p>
<p>Paddington’s other dates with Claire and Simone were met with similar success and indulgence. This carried on for one delicious month and Paddington thought to himself, “Yes, maybe this is a bear’s true nature after all.” But the next morning he awoke feeling very peculiar. It was not the same funny feeling he felt a month ago, but rather this time his throat was all scritchy and his nose was quite dribbley. Not knowing what to do he called for young Judy from his bed. After examining him, she exclaimed, “Why, you’re sick!” “Well, that’s very regressive of you,” retorted Paddington. “It’s my right to explore my true bear nature.” “No no, I mean you’ve come down with an illness,” said Judy. “I thought bears didn’t get sick,” she said. “I thought we didn’t either,” replied Paddington. “Hmm, this is serious. Let’s ask mother,” said Judy. When Mrs. Brown was in the room they explained the situation. “I think this might have something to do with your new ‘habits,’” said Mrs. Brown. “Really?” said paddington. “Indeed, I remember a time during my youth where I had a similar experience,” she said with a reminiscent giggle. “Just get some rest and limit your ‘fun’ for a while and you should be right as rain in no time.”
</p>
<p>At this news, Paddington phoned Claire to let her know the unfortunate news since they had a date that day. But upon telling her she replied with, “Well you don’t have to lie if you don’t want to see me. I guess this was too good to be true. Goodbye, Paddington!” and she hung up before he could say another word. “Oh, I guess she had to go urgently, he thought. “Well, it’s for the best I suppose. On to Simone and Heather.” But when he called he received similar responses and Paddington once again found himself single. “No matter,” he thought, “at least I still have my orange marmalade.” It wasn’t until he finished two jars that he finally felt better. And he hopped out of bed to stretch his legs. Down stairs he saw Mr. Brown. “Glad to see you up and about again,” said Mr. Brown. “Yes, I’m glad as well,” said Paddington. “And that funny feeling has finally left. Perhaps, a bear's true nature is to not have a true nature after all.”
