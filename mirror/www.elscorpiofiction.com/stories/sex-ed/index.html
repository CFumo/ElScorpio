		<div id='text'><p><p>David let himself into Teresa’s apartment—she always left the door unlocked when someone was coming over. He heard her clinking glass in the kitchen.
</p>
<p>“Dave?” she called.
</p>
<p>“Yeah it’s me. Hey, thanks again for doing this.”
</p>
<p>“Ha! What else are friends for?” she said.
</p>
<p>David grimaced as she entered the living room. “Christ, do you really think we’re gonna need the whole box?”
</p>
<p>Teresa winked at him. “No, I just wanted to see you sweat a little bit.”
</p>
<p>She set a box of tampons on the coffee table and handed David a beer. He took it somberly.
</p>
<p>“Relax, you dork,” she said. “I think it’s sweet that you wanna do this. I can’t believe she’s already fourteen…”
</p>
<p>“Tell me about it,” said David, running a hand through his hair. “Ok sensei, show me how it’s done.”
</p>
<p>“Are you sure you’re ready for this?” she teased. “I’m about to shatter the Feminine Mystique here.”
</p>
<p>“Yeah right. I saw you shave your armpits when we were dating, that was bad enough.”
</p>
<p>“I know that turned you on, don’t deny it.”
</p>
<p>Teresa took a tampon out of the box and squeezed one end to pop it out of the wrapper. She held up the blue applicator.
</p>
<p>“Ok so basically, the actual tampon’s in this thick part, and the thin part’s the plunger. You use this to push the tampon in, see at this end where there’s an opening?”
</p>
<p>David nodded grimly.
</p>
<p>Teresa put the thick part between two fingers, and her thumb at the thin end, like a doctor holding a needle.
</p>
<p>“Ok so, you put the opening of the applicator right up against the opening of the vagina—”
</p>
<p>“Oh God,” said David, “I don’t know if I can do this. Maybe you should just explain it to her.”
</p>
<p>“Don’t be a wuss Dave, it’s not like you’ll have to watch. Besides, even if you chicken out, it’s good for you to know how it works. So, you stick it right up against the opening and push the plunger all the way.”
</p>
<p>Teresa pressed the plunger until the tampon popped out of the applicator and flopped onto the couch beside them. David picked it up and rolled it between his fingers.
</p>
<p>“If you did it right, just the string should be hanging out,” said Teresa. “When you wanna take it out, you just yank on the string. And you’re not supposed to leave it in for more than seven hours.”
</p>
<p>David peered thoughtfully at the tampon. “I almost can’t believe you guys have to deal with this shit.”
</p>
<p>“It definitely sucks,” said Teresa. “And mine lasts a week too. I’m literally bleeding out of my vagina a quarter of the time, can you believe that? I don’t know if the increased longevity makes up for it.”
</p>
<p>“I dunno,” said David. “When I was a kid and I got the talk… I remember feeling really sad that I couldn’t have a baby. Guess I got over it.”
</p>
<p>Teresa threw her head back and laughed. “When my mom told me how pregnancy worked I cried for like half an hour.”
</p>
<p>“Why?” asked David, laughing.
</p>
<p>“Scared, I guess,” said Teresa. “I didn’t get over it.”
</p>
<p>“You don’t think you’ll get bit by the baby bug at some point?”
</p>
<p>“Not if I can help it! I mean, don’t get me wrong, Claire’s great. But I just get to do the whole cool aunt thing. I’m not the one who has to deal with the dirty diapers and the acne problems.”
</p>
<p>David laughed. “Yeah well, when you love your kid… I dunno… that stuff doesn't really matter.”
</p>
<p>“You’re too cute, Dave,” said Teresa. She pointed her beer at him. “You know, I don’t tell you this enough. But you’re doing a good job. I know it’s been hard since Moira left, but… you’re a good dad. She’s lucky to have you.”
</p>
<p>“Don’t get all sappy on me, T,” said David.
</p>
<p>“Ok ok, we’ll just be shallow and juvenile like always.”
</p>
<p>“That’s more like it. Speaking of which, what time does the game start?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, you jerk, so that’s what you’re really here for.”
</p>
<p>They clinked glasses, grinning.
