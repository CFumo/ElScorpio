		<div id='text'><p><p><em>Prompt:
	</em>
</p>
<p><em>Re-imagine the classic story of Little Red Riding hood in the style of Lovecraftian Horror + Comedy.</em><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Red scrambled out of a thicket and into a clearing. Finally, she had reached the mausoleum where her grandmother was entombed. The enormous gothic structure had long ago fallen into ruin, and had then become a popular destination for practitioners of the occult until even the most extreme and dedicated among their number could no longer bear the psychological strain of entering the building. Its great halls had seemingly outgrown the confines of reality; winding for miles through spaces that so clearly violated the structure’s exterior dimensions as to frighten away every demolition team sent to dismantle the property. It was said that merely setting foot in the building would drive the mind into an unending spiral of insanity.
</p>
<p>Red checked her basket again to be sure she hadn’t dropped anything. Readying a flashlight, she stepped through the doorway and into the great building.
</p>
<p>“Oh grandmother, what an enormous scary tomb you have,” she muttered, shining her light into the hallway. Out of the corner of her eye she saw something large and decidedly non-humanoid skitter into a dark crevice. It was probably one of the children of Shub-Niggurath, wandering around aimlessly like the blithering idiot it most certainly was. That Black Goat was so busy spawning her thousand minions that she apparently couldn’t bother to teach them that it is not okay to urinate indoors.
</p>
<p>“Oh grandmother, what an awful stench you have!” Red yelled into the dark hallway. The denizens of this mausoleum were purported to demand monstrous sacrifices in return for their gifts of forbidden knowledge. Knowledge of the impossible geometry of the ancients, and of the Black Speech that could warp reality in but a single utterance. By now, Red understood most of the creatures in the building well enough to know that they talked a big game but other than looking weird they were mostly harmless. The mindflayer that had consumed her grandmother and taken up residence in this mausoleum somehow still believed that its disguise was working, even as her grandmother’s skin began to rot and fall off of the creature’s slimy tentacles.
</p>
<p>“I brought your favorite kind!” Red yelled, holding up a small bag of marijuana.
</p>
<p>“White Widow.”
</p>
<p>A blistering cold descended on the hallway as the mindflayer floated forward from the darkness. The tattered remains of Red’s grandmother clung to its tentacles by a few sinewy strands of tissue. A number of the spider-like children of Shub-Niggurath gathered on the walls and ceiling to watch as Red and the mindflayer sparked a joint and took turns smoking it, musing on the impossibly alien architecture of the mausoleum.
