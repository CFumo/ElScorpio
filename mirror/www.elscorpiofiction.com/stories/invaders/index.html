		<div id='text'><p><p>The <em>Fairwind </em>[note: monikers transliterated] was an aging Class K stellar mining vessel on its penultimate voyage. Orbiting HD 40307, it was passing out of the transition region and entering cooldown when it picked up a distress call from the space around Gliese 422. The captain was compelled to answer it; irrationally so, as it seemed to some of the technicians onboard.
</p>
<p>The <em>Fairwind </em>received temporary human approval to enter the colonial zone around Gliese 422. As they approached the source of the distress call they encountered three other vessels: two auoala warships, <em>The Later Coming and Envy</em>; and a human freighter called <em>Sun Dog</em>. All had come to answer the distress call, which now appeared to be sourceless. Or rather, the source seemed to be a small fixed point in empty space. Within kilometers of the source, every person on all four ships died suddenly without pain or sound; all except Rvraika, a stellar astrophysicist aboard the <em>Fairwind</em>.
</p>
<p>Rvraika's mind filled with terrible knowledge. Beings from Outside had "reentered the world" after eons, and found a recent and alarming phenomenon spreading through the universe: life. Whole galaxies were choked with living creatures; they swarmed between the stars. These Other Beings found "life" to be a crude, cancerous, and revolting form of intelligence. They themselves were eternal and immortal, did not grow or reproduce, and were not "alive." They saw the existence of life forms as intolerable. They were bent on destroying all life, and could not be stopped. They'd summoned the ships to begin the extermination, leaving one of the creatures alive with their full revelation to serve as a warning.
</p>
<p>To Rvraika, one thing was immediately obvious: this was psychological warfare. If they were unstoppable, and had no sympathy for the living, why would they bother drafting him as their grim prophet? Because they were stoppable, and somehow needed to resort to this tactic. He tried toâ€¦ <em>not </em>have this thought. Because they were inside his mind, and even given his suspicions, there was no telling what they would do or what they were capable of.
