		<div id='text'><p><p>Sounds of whirring ellipticals, rowing machines, and hamster wheels. Rhythmic clinking of weights and the occasional slams of deadlift plates on the floor. Cheese smell.
</p>
<p>5:55 PM August 26 2016
</p>
<p>Rhino Rat could bench 500 boulders, and squat with 400 boulders on his shoulders. One day he was on the elliptical machine. He was listening to “Breaking the Habit” by Linkin Park on loop on his iPod. He was scowling at Marvin Mouse. In his head, he was hearing his friend Brittney Bear’s words played over and over: “You know what they say. Two body builders can’t <em>just </em>be friends.”
</p>
<p>Rhino and Marvin’s relationship started off as plain old mean-spirited rivalry. Rhino standing at the workout log posted on the wall, absently rubbing sweat out of his fur with his sweat towel. <em>700 revolutions </em>on the hamster wheel?? What the fuck??? Rhino knew he could top that. Who did that skeezy mouse think he was?
</p>
<p>But how long was someone supposed to jealously obsessed over someone else’s stellar workout routine without building up some fucking admiration? Jeez. He had to clear his head. He shook his whiskers and headed for the squat rack.
</p>
<p>“Hey bro, what the fuck?”
</p>
<p>Oh god. Oh god oh god oh god. Marvin was talking to him. <em>Play it cool</em>, Rhino. He’s just another rodent. With bulging muscles. Rhino chanced a tiny glance at the mouse. Even his tail looked buff. Jesus fuck.
</p>
<p>He felt Marvin’s hand smack his shoulder. The way Rhino saw it he had two options. Turn around, and A) fucking slug the little motherfucker, or B) fucking start making out right here in the middle of the gym.
</p>
<p>5:55 PM August 26 2016
</p>
<p>Marvin Mouse finished his cardio warmup. Time for his favorite exercise? No, that yoked rat was still hogging it all. No matter. He could finish off with chest... though if he wanted to start with legs he would’ve changed up his pre-workout shake. Such bullshit. Marvin went to refill his Nalgene and focused on his quads, glutes, and calves- his workout visualization ritual.
</p>
<p><em>Flex. Relax. Flex. Relax.</em> He repeated the words in his head.
</p>
<p>What the fuck? What the fuck was that rat doing? Was he seriously heading for the last squat rack? No fucking way. And he didn’t even rerack the bench plates.
</p>
<p>Marvin jogged over. “Hey bro, what the fuck?“
</p>
<p>Rhino Rat didn’t turn his big-eared head. He just slid on another 45 onto the bar and leaned to get another.
</p>
<p>“Uhh, BRO! I said ‘what the FUCK’!” Marvin Mouse gave Rhino a pat on the shoulder that was not altogether gentle. This motherfucker was getting on Marvin’s nerves.
</p>
<p>This is where shit got real. Rhino whirled around, earbuds flinging from his head. Marvin was hoping that some shit was gonna get started (he hadn’t been in a fight before, but he really liked Walker, Texas Ranger).
</p>
<p>“What the FUCK. BRO-oaah!” Rhino had his beefy right arm ready and everything. He was coming in to clock Marvin, but tripped over his gym bag.
</p>
<p>A loud CRASH as the rodents toppled over and sent a bar stand to the ground. Marvin lashed out with his tail to grab onto the squat cage, but ended up with it twisting around Rhino’s longer, thicker one. He felt the rat’s larger body encompass him and lost his will to fight. In fact, he lost his consciousness.
</p>
<p>An eternity later, Marvin woke up in the grassy square between the lifting hall and the pool. His head hurt like hell and he felt gauze when he reached up to touch it.
</p>
<p>“What… the fuck… bro,” he rasped.
</p>
<p>“Hey bro,” a deep, sonorous voice said. “You knocked your head on a kettlebell when we took that spill in there.” Marvin looked toward the source of the voice but was blinded by the setting sun. “You got all tensed up, bro. Had me in a reflexive hold. Helluva grip you’ve got there. Hugged me real tight. Crenshaw Cat and Stan Squirrel could barely loose your grip.”
</p>
<p>“What… bro. What are we doing out here?” Marvin said, his voice coming through stronger.
</p>
<p>“Your tail, bro. Your tail is fuckin’ toned. Wrapped up around mine and it won’t come off. Care to…” Rhino moved and eclipsed the sun. He had the most beautiful face Marvin had ever seen. His smile was sincere. And was there something else?
</p>
<p>“...care to detach?”
</p>
<p>“Not just yet, bro.” Marvin said, and put his big, vascular hand onto the larger rodent’s pumped forearm. “Not just yet.”
</p>
<p>2:23 AM August 27 2016
</p>
<p>They went back to Rhino’s place and he took it up the ass.
