		<div id='text'><p><p>It's been 3 days, 4 hours, and 8 minutes since you've left me. Which means this letter is useless. You were the only one who still wrote anymore. When the doctor gave me your letter he looked at me with pity. As if to say, "I'm sorry this is all he left." As if it weren't enough.
</p>
<p>I remember when you taught me how to write. It was a rainy Saturday afternoon and we had planned to go to the beach. I was in a bad mood because work had been difficult and I was really looking forward to the trip. You handed me a pen and paper and told me I should write out my anger because it would be more personal. Meaningful shouting, without causing a disturbance. We laughed as you showed me how to hold the pen properly, only to find that we were opposite hands. You taught me the correct order to do the strokes for an "F". I think it was the only time I saw you write something legible. To be honest, handwriting always seemed daunting because I thought I had to do it like yours. All the times I was nearly late for work because I had tried to decipher a note you'd left. Only to find that you had written, "Have a good day, love. I ordered dessert for us tonight: 14 months!" Perhaps you were preparing me for the letter. Your last. It took me an hour to get through it all, especially near the end when your script got even worse. I wish I had started earlier.
</p>
<p>I'm not proud of how I've acted these past 3 days. I snuck some of the anti-emotion pills from your office. I know they were supposed to be for you to keep you calm before they let you go. They ran out today so now I feel everything. Which isn't so different from feeling nothing at all. Emptiness.
</p>
<p>I watched the tape of your last moments. I paid extra for the virtual reality version. Just so I could almost stroke your hair and almost hold your face. You were babbling incoherently. You kept yelling, "The dog!" and my name and that you knew I'd find it. That last part would calm you for a little while. Did you mean anything by it? What dog? Or was your mind already going? I know you were trying to tell me something in your letter.  I wish you'd had more time to finish it. You know puzzles were never my strong suit.
</p>
<p>I hate this. I hate them. I've been cleaning out the apartment. They're relocating me in 2 days to move in a new couple. Already. Because now that it's just me, I take up too much space, too much of their fucking finite resources. I want to scream until I'm dead. How can I leave our home? The scuff marks on the floor, the chip on the bathroom counter. They're ours. It's like they're trying to erase everything I have left of you.
</p>
<p>I tried to get your office done yesterday. I know I told you not to worry and that I'd do it when you're gone, but it's awful. There's paper everywhere. And don't get me started on all the paperweights. Why must you collect something so archaic? I was sorting through your thesis drafts yesterday (seriously, why did you keep them all?) and when I went to get the next stack I grabbed them too quickly and sent The Four-Legged-Friends set flying off the desk. You would've laughed. All but Brutus broke. I remember being slightly amused (antiemotional pills at work) and thinking it was weird how his collar looked like a-
</p>
<p>No. Is that what you were trying to tell me? "The dog"? "My office"? "Directions"? Is he storing something? Oh god. I need to go. I need to go find him.
