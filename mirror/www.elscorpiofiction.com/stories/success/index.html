		<div id='text'><p><p>Will she like me?
</p>
<p>What if I stutter over my words?
</p>
<p>I don't want to make eye contact. But I do. But I know that if I make eye contact, she'll be able to read my mind and my thoughts. What if she asks how I'm doing and I say 'fine' even though I'm not fine? I'm really thinking about how nervous I am to do this. There are a lot of options and I know what I may want, but I'm not 100% sure. What if I regret my decision? Is it really that big of a deal? No one else is paying such rapt attention at what decision I'm making. And certainly no one knows what I want better than me. Myself. I. It's really quite simple. There's nothing to worry about. But why am I worrying? This sure is stupid. Well then why can't I snap out of it? Jeez are my palms sweating now? And here comes the throttling white noise and forehead tension. My breath. Is shortening. Eyes BIG. Okay I've got to say something now or they'll know something is grossly wrong with me. They. And she. Especially she. And I can't have that. I've got to hide the fear. And just get on with. But I've got to make sure I don't make a fool of myself. Look inconspicuous. Smile. But not too much. That's weird. Look at her. But not too long. God, stop being so self-absorbed. Really. I'm not getting on with it. Okay, now I will. She's raising an eyebrow. She's looking at me with that tense, impatient smirk-smile. I can see the sweet contempt and grotesque pity in those dancing eyes. Green. Moss. Romantic. Oh she can see I'm getting lost in her eyes. Avert. Say it. Just say it.

<p>"Hi."
</p>
<p>"Hi. What would you like?"
</p>
<p>"Can I get a large cafe latte? Please."
</p>
<p>"Sure. Is that all for you?"
</p>
<p>"Yeah."
</p>
<p>"Your total is $4.50."
</p>
<p>"Ok."
</p>
<p>"What's your name?"
</p>
<p>"Cameron"
</p>
<p>"We'll call your name when it's ready."
</p>
<p>"K. Thanks."
</p>
<p>Success.
