		<div id='text'><p><p>The invasion of Earth by the Tsk was relatively smooth, all things considered. There was some initial resistance, but military strength is only one of many ways in which the Tsk are superior to humans, and the coalition of world leaders quickly conceded that their proverbial resistance was futile.
</p>
<p>And after all, the demands of our conquerors were not so great. By happenstance, the human body produces a previously undiscovered organic compound known as 15-theta-C when fed the right raw materials. This compound is a very valuable resource to the Tsk, though to us humans, its uses are mysterious.
</p>
<p>So they came to Earth in their crystal ships with their unstoppable weapons and their intellectual superiority. And every 58 days, all humans are required to report to their local 15Î˜C Extraction Branch, where the compound is harvested harmlessly and we are sent on our way equipped to brew a new batch.
</p>
<p>Other than that, human life has carried on much like normal. Better than normal, in some ways. The Tsk are possessed of many incredible powers. They can control the weather. They can bend and slow light at will. They can produce food out of thin air. They have not prevented our scientists from trying to reverse-engineer their miraculous technologies. We are apparently incapable of understanding them. They must hide their secrets from us no more than a man must cover his dog's eyes before turning the combination lock on his safe.
</p>
<p>I was fourteen when the Tsk invaded, so I remember the time before their presence, but I can hardly believe it. Going to have my blood combed through feels as normal as going to the grocery store. I've grown used to the advantages: we live longer; our food is cheaper; our water and air are cleaner. Our reproduction is constrained but not directed, and many are happy to take advantage of perfect contraception. There are many who still resent being turned into cattle, of course. But, as I said, resistance was futile.
</p>
<p>The Tsk recognize human beings as sentient but consider that fact to be inconsequential. It was certainly irrelevant when it came to our subjugation. It should come as no surprise, considering their alienness, that their values and ethics are different from our own, although just how different, no one can be sure. Our communication is imperfect. Due to our congenital lack of intelligence, we are unable to understand much of their thinking. But we also have some of our own emotions and ideas which they seem unable to grasp. In a way, these concepts are treasured as marks of our humanity.
</p>
<p>Despite these differences, it is possible for a human and a Tska to have a meaningful interaction, even a meaningful relationship in some cases. Opportunities for interaction are fairly common, given that each extraction branch is equipped with an administrative staff that resides on the planet. For them, many human behaviors are sources of amusement, or the equivalent positive stimulation. I once saw a Tska express something like delight over my ability to solve a linear equation. Like I was a dog performing an unlikely trick. These "tricks" have become a sort of informal currency between us. Would you like some extra food? Want the sun to come out for your son's birthday party? Roll over. Burn your offering at the altar and pray that it pleases.
</p>
<p>I suppose it's just one more thing that fails to set us apart from the animals: we aren't above begging.
