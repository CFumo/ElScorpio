		<div id='text'><p><p>My name is Nightmare Doomsong, and I am a Lichtwielder. I was summoned by the Mageking on secret business. Handsomely dressed footmen greeted me at the palace gates, and I was given hot wine and a bath. After resting, I took the spinshaft up to the offices of the Archpriest.
</p>
<p>"Thank you for coming, Madame," said the Archpriest as he shook my hand. "We've been unable to access the Godhead for the past 71 hours. Some in the city are already becoming soulsick."
</p>
<p>He showed me the error logs on the main computer terminal.
</p>
<p>"I'm afraid someone will have to interface with the Godhead directly," he said.
</p>
<p>He typed a command into the computer to unlock the door to the Sanctorium. I went inside.
</p>
<p>The excessive incense could not quite conceal the thick, dark stench of the place. I passed the votive gardens and clusters of murmuring priests to reach the Reliquary. I approached the door and peered through the tiny window. In the dim light I could just make out the huge, distended body of the Godhead. Even with the excess of Licht in my blood I could approach no further, but I could extend myself into the body telepathically. I did so now, leaving behind several fluoresced points that I could link back to later. Then I exited the Sanctorium.
</p>
<p>"Did you find anything?" asked the Archpriest.
</p>
<p>"I need to consult my texts," I said. My bad knee was starting to ache, and I was eager to be home. "I'd like a copy of the access logs for further examination."
</p>
<p>He game me the information I needed on a micro-diskette.
</p>
<p>"How will you care for the ill, in the meantime?" I asked.
</p>
<p>"We'll have to make due with artificial absolution for now." He shook my hand warmly. "Thank you again, Madame. May you go with grace."
</p>
<p>I was silently amused by his choice of parting words. A Lichtwielder has no need for grace.
</p>
<p>When I returned to my burrow, I went straight to my library, put my feet up, and paged through my copy of Anthem for the Apocalypse. It contained sheet music and stage notes for Idris Llewellyn's infamous 200-hour opera; not related to the present situation, but it helped to clear my head. Then I switched to Saphrite Maelthrose's Gloss of Superphysical Anomalies and Helena Ravewater's Anatomy of the Damned.
</p>
<p>I fed the Archpriest's data into my computer, then mentally reconnected to the Godhead, wiring myself to the computer so it could help me process the sensations. The procedure was more difficult when done remotely. I could not touch the mind without risking soulsickness, and without directly viewing the body, it was harder to orient myself. Luckily I am very skilled. The fluoresced points were already beginning to decay, so my vision was dim, but I gathered enough information for the computer to begin several important calculations.
</p>
<p>Even a state-of-the-art computer can take several hours to follow the steps of the Ravewater algorithm. While it labored, I went to my nest and slept.
</p>
<p>I woke up suddenly in the night. Two Nightworlders were in my nestroom. I tensed for battle, then relaxed when I sensed that they meant me no immediate harm. One was very tall and very pale, with a purple flame for a head. The other one was a pair of large black wings, fluttering wildly like the wings of a bat, so that it was difficult to see the little body between them. I shook hands with the one, and let the other brush my face with its wingtips.
</p>
<p>"Madame Doomsong," said the purple flame. "I am here to show you the being that corrupted your Godhead."
</p>
<p>"Why concern yourself with human affairs?" I asked.
</p>
<p>"The politics of Mortinia affect the politics of the Nightworld," it said. It reached out to me and I took its pale hands in mine. I felt it touch my mind through the Licht. In the haze of blue and violet I saw a vision of a richly furnished subterranean chamber. On a throne built entirely of human skulls sat a huge red man: horned head, bulging with demonical muscle, and swathed in a clock of black velvet. Its face was obscured in shadow, but I could just see its horrible, gleaming black eye.
</p>
<p>The vision ended and we unclasped hands.
</p>
<p>"And I am here," said the black wings, "to ask you not to repair the Godhead. In exchange, I can return your husband and son to you from the Fartherland."
</p>
<p>I hid a smile. Ten years ago I would have been tempted to accept. But now, my soul was so warped by Licht-use that I sickened at the thought of reuniting with my loved ones. I declined, and the Nightworlders departed.
</p>
<p>By then my computer had finished its calculations. I loaded the access repair program onto a micro-diskette and returned to the palace, to undo what was done by the mysterious red man.
