		<div id='text'><p><p>So as you can see from the simulation, your idea of putting parquet on the back wall will have no effect except to deplete the balance a little. What the analysis shows is to just paint it a really stark green. Any amount of green will do, but the starker, the better, you get the point.
</p>
<p>I'm still going to put parquet on that wall, Greg.
</p>
<p>But you just saw the simulation. It's not like...
</p>
<p>So what. It's just some simulation.
</p>
<p>No, you.. yes. It's a simulation. But it's the most perfect simulation. It's like looking at an alternate reality. You might as well be, it's that perfect.
</p>
<p>And I'm supposed to just believe that?
</p>
<p>Yes, basically. At least believe that parquet on the back wall is not a good idea.
</p>
<p>But I really want to.
</p>
<p>Well, it's not going to do anything for the store.
</p>
<p>How does it even work, anyway? Can't we just make it work?
</p>
<p>Make what work?
</p>
<p>The simulation.
</p>
<p>What?
</p>
<p>Can't we just make it show that the parquet will work?
</p>
<p>How?
</p>
<p>I don't know, introduce some other parameters or something.
</p>
<p>That would probably not line up well with the reality spectral.
</p>
<p>Look, don't think you're throwing me off with some buzzwords. I read the whitepapers.
</p>
<p>I'm not. It's not complicated. And good, you know then how hard it is to locate a shitload of new normals.
</p>
<p>But I still want that parquet!
</p>
<p>Why?
</p>
<p>It'll look nice.
</p>
<p>No it won't.
</p>
<p>How dare you! At least you can admit it would be nice, even if it isn't preciously "profitable" to you.
</p>
<p>No, it would look terrible.
</p>
<p>Worse than a stark fucking green, you crass fucking lunatic?
</p>
<p>No, of course not. I don't want stark green. It's just the change with the best result from base.
</p>
<p>Why a goddamn green? It'll clash with literally everything.
</p>
<p>Maybe that's why it works. I don't fucking know.
</p>
<p>So we're not putting any parquet on the back wall?
</p>
<p>I have to veto that. It's purely cost.
</p>
<p>Oh like your simulator wasn't.
</p>
<p>Seems to me like it already paid for itself.
</p>
<p>Doesn't work like that.
</p>
<p>Whatever, I'm happy.
</p>
<p>That's nice. So have you explored it?
</p>
<p>Explored what?
</p>
<p>The simulation?
</p>
<p>Uh, no.
</p>
<p>Why not?
</p>
<p>It just-
</p>
<p>What?
</p>
<p>It kind of worries me, I guess.
</p>
<p>Can I try it?
</p>
<p>I guess.
</p>
<p>Why are you so worried all of a sudden? You bought the damn thing.
</p>
<p>I don't know. It just worries me is all.
</p>
<p>How? You weren't so worried about fucking my parquet up.
</p>
<p>Well, business is different. You're gonna use it for personal shit.
</p>
<p>Obviously, how could I not?
</p>
<p>I guess you're right. But, ok, imagine you're using this thing to like win your crush over.
</p>
<p>What's there not to like?
</p>
<p>Ok, but so you want to do that by using it to premeditate all your moves, just so you can have what you want?
</p>
<p>Yeah?
</p>
<p>You don't have a problem with how it eliminates, like, the personal factor or anything like that?
</p>
<p>Not really?
</p>
<p>Huh. Okay, well, I mean, okay then. You want to test it out now or after lunch?
</p>
<p>Oh man, we should totally go down to - what's that place called-
</p>
<p>I don-
</p>
<p>The weird place, the one where nothing matched and they had those boxy hats and just said nonsense all the time? Oh my god, you don't remember?
</p>
<p>Oh, God, yeah, of course, uh. It's-
</p>
<p>Bob's.
</p>
<p>Was that it?
</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.
</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Huh.
