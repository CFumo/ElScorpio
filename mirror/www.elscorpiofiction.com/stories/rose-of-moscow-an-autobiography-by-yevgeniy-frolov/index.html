		<div id='text'><p><p>I was born to a devoutly Russian family under a full moon in the dead of winter. With the snow-white wind howling outside, and a rosary clutched in my fat baby fist, I knew then that my destiny would be to upset the tyranny of the Church, crush the bonds of patriarchal government, and pave the way for socialist anarchy. Workers of the world, unite!
</p>
<p>When I was still a lad I escaped into the woods to begin my tutelage with the old witch Bab Yaga. I was more a potential meal than a potential pupil, and more than once I felt her sharp iron teeth. But I was wiley enough to avoid the worst of her torture, and eventually she took me under her wing. All day we flew through the woods and she taught my her black magic, while at night she whispered pagan secrets to me over kasha and tea as black as my soul.
</p>
<p>At the dawn of the new millennium I moved to the states with my family. My mother hoped for a new life. I, for the downfall of capitalism and a new uprising by the young and godless.
</p>
<p>I was enrolled in Catholic school—a notorious breeding ground for radicals and heretics—and there I joined my first satanic cult. During my time with them I read a lot of high-brow literature and drank my fair share of fake blood before forming the noise-metal band MC Murder Jesus with some of my comrades. MCMJ was wildly successful, and I used the money I earned to make several calculated investments.
</p>
<p>Finally I amassed enough money to purchase a house—my base of operations. As I crossed the threshold, I mused bleakly that I had to play me enemy's game to defeat him. Even now as I sit at my desk, writing this book and swirling my glassful of kvass, I struggle not to succumb to the luxury of apathy and self-contempt. I won't let it get to me. For my cause is just, and I have nothing to lose but my chains.
