		<div id='text'><p><p>Heavy rain and thunder cast a grim mood over the Marion Freudberg Bioengineering Building. Around midnight, Dr. Madson and her assistant Deepak Singh were still in the lab synthesizing artificial sweeteners for diabetes experiments. They'd used money from another grant to purchase the rats, raw chemicals, and new lab equipment, a fact that weighed heavily on the young Singh. He was in fact expressing his discomfort with the matter at that very moment.
</p>
<p>"We've already been over this, Singh. We're up against a strict deadline on this project, and the Freudberg-Rothchild account is underspent this year. It'll come back around, you'll see."
</p>
<p>Madson left to smoke a cigarette at the back of the building. The storm gloom made the corridors darker than usual. Her breath appeared in chilled puffs, and an eerie wind rustled the folds of her lab coat.
</p>
<p>"Blasted draft," she muttered. But when she rounded the corner, she saw something that made her skin creep with horror. A spectral figure stood motionless at the end of the hallway. It was the ghost of Dr. Freudberg; Madson recognized her from the portrait in the lobby.
</p>
<p>"That money was for cancer research," said the phantom, in a voice heavy with the weight of the grave.
</p>
<p>"Good God!" cried Madson. Then there was a terrible shriek from back down the hallway. Madson turned and raced toward the sound, but too late. She found the lab consumed by the flames of a raging chemical fire, with Singh caught in the blaze.
