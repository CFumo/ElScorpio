		<div id='text'><p><p>John woke up that morning at 5:30. It was fifteen minutes before his alarm would go off, but he could already tell he would be hitting that snooze button. It didn't seem to matter what time he went to bed the night before, he would always feel absolutely exhausted on mornings he had work.
</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, John was in the shower.  Shampooing his hair, he felt a sense of pride that he had gotten out of bed before the snooze alarm went off. "Shit," he muttered. He had forgotten to turn that snooze alarm off.  His roommates were going to love that...
</p>
<p>There was about a 3 minute pause in between putting on each sock. The closer John got to leaving for work, the slower he moved. Fridays were always the worst.
</p>
<p>John worked at a small clothing store at the nearby mall. In between folding shirts and restocking shelves, he greeted customers and prayed he could get injured enough to go home with worker's comp.
</p>
<p>The third customer John worked with had no concept of personal space. Every time John attempted to move slightly farther away, the customer would make an equal if not more substantial move in John's direction. After nearly knocking over a mannequin, John realized he was pinned against a clothing display. He was stuck. Five minutes later, John walked away knowing far too much about this man's daughters and knowing exactly what his lunch had smelled like.
</p>
<p>The day crawled on very slowly, especially when a middle-aged woman erupted into a screaming fit after being told she could not return a pair of panties. The woman claimed they ripped on the third wear and demanded they be returned. John could not fathom why this woman would think a store would want a pair of ripped and worn panties back. He also could not fathom how gross the word "panties" was. That's when John realized she was now screaming, asking if he was even paying attention to her. After throwing the panties on the ground in a show of defiance and knocking over a display of sweaters, the woman stormed out of the store.
</p>
<p>John clocked out on time.
</p>
<p>John's usual ride home couldn't be there to pick him up today, so he was forced to take the bus. A homeless man berated John for at least 7 stops, but was seated at least 3 rows away. John considered this a successful bus ride.
</p>
<p>John put his bowl in the microwave and set it for three minutes. He immediately regretted not putting a paper towel over it as the chili sputtered and splashed on the ceiling of his microwave. This wasn't enough to get him to take any action. He always thought making chili looked fun and easy, but he would always get lazy and settle for the canned kind.
</p>
<p>Waiting for his dinner to heat up, John pulled out a newspaper. He knew that he could just read the news online, not that he did, but holding a newspaper just made him feel like he looked smarter, looked cooler even. He always made sure to buy and stare at it somewhere in public. He never got much reading done doing this. He was always more concerned with if other people saw him reading a newspaper than with what was written within it.
</p>
<p>The chili burned the roof of John's mouth a little.
</p>
<p>After three hours of watching television, John began to debate what he should do. He was considering masturbating, but he felt tired and wanted to go to bed. His go-to website had been disappointing him lately. He had been relying more and more on imagination. He didn't have any lotion or tissues nearby, either. His motivation was falling quickly.
</p>
<p>John masturbated.
</p>
<p>John let out a heavy sigh as he hit his bed. It was already 10:45. He definitely wasn't getting 8 hours of sleep tonight. He had to be up again at 5:30.  Saturdays were always the worst.
</p>
<p>John had a brain aneurysm that night. His body was found 3 days later when a coworker was worried about him missing work.
