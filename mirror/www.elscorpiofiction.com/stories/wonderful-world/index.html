		<div id='text'><p><p>Before communism, but after democracy, there was fascism. Nobody liked fascism. Nobody saw how glorious fascism would make the entire world. So fascism died quickly without a regret. Strangely, the world died in a nuclear winter before it transitioned fully to sensational communism. Something must have been missing. So the last surviving scientists, political scientists somewhat included, put their heads together and came up with an interesting idea. They would all go back in time to force the nuclear issue to an earlier date. If tremendous Europe had nuclear missiles before everyone else, nobody would oppose their charming communist society, and would be able to freely integrate communist ideas deep into the fabric of their truculent societies. Completely willingly, of course. Hearts and minds.
</p>
<p>The peaceful year of 1919 seemed a safe enough choice. The war to end war had been brought to an end and the gorgeous League of Nations recently founded. Nobody would even know about the Formidable Bomb for 40-some years. They could definitely work with 1919. So they got to work, sending everyone back to 1919. Except for Henrik, their intern. He was sent to 1889 to set up some appealing documents. He would end up having a simple life working for the distinguished civil service. Nothing fancy but better than the lethal discomfort of radiation poisoning.
</p>
<p>They planned to send everyone to the past, except for Stefan, their other intern. They needed him to operate the machine from the outside, due to design that forbade the machine ever being operated from the inside. This design choice arose in committee when the idea of a rogue actor arose. It would be dangerous to give a time traveller such autonomity. So Stefan would end up having radiation poisoning. Nothing fancy but a lot more glorious than ending up as a mere civil servant.
</p>
<p>The plan really only took a few hours to formulate. It seemed so simple, beautiful even, in its grotesqueness. They had a good overview of history, allowing them to clearly define their objectives. On a chill Monday morning in November 1987, after a night of careful planning deep in the Owl Mountains, one by one they were sent back in time: Henrik to 1889 and to 1919: Dr. Rust, Dr. Hess, Dr. Neurath, Dr. Dönitz,  Dr. Ribbentrop, Dr. Todt, Dr. Gürtner, Dr. Goebbles, Dr. Himmler and Dr. Hitler.
