		<div id='text'><p><p>I'd like to start off this toast by saying cheers to me for introducing the bride and groom.
</p>
<p>If you'd told me a year ago that Jess and Carl would be getting married I'd have said, "Really? I don't think Carl is cool enough for her." Sorry Carl, but we all know you're a huge nerd. But what he lacks in coolness he makes up for in heart.
</p>
<p>After every one of my break ups he's been there to console me, always saying, "Don't worry. He's out there. He's just waiting for you to find him." Carl has willingly come over to comfort a puddle of tears and a bag of emotions. I know I'm pegging myself as a serial dater, but I'm willing to do that to make a point: Nine times he's brought over a Costco pumpkin pie, a bottle of wine, and 500 Days of Summer because you never know when you'll get to Autumn.
</p>
<p>I've known Carl since we were 8, back when I was slightly taller than him. Let me tell you, he's the best person to go camping with in the dead of winter, the best person to get caught skinny dipping with, and the best person to dance with because he'll surely distract from your own dancing skills. You should ask him about all of these things so he'll get embarrassed.
</p>
<p>Now Jess. I met Jess freshman year of college when we both showed up to a Halloween party dressed as Thing One without Things Twos in tow. We had two options: hate each other or become best friends. I'll let you guess which one we picked.
</p>
<p>Jess is the life of the party. When she walks in a room, everyone feels a bit happier. Seriously! She'll strike up a conversation with a stranger and leave them feeling like a lifelong friend. I've only known her 6 years but it feels like 20.
</p>
<p>I'm so excited to meet little baby Stevenson. I already know she'll be amazing because her parents are my two favorite people in the world. To your happiness and your future family. Cheers.
</p></p></div>
