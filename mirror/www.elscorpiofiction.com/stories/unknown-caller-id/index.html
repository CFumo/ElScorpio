		<div id='text'><p><p>Victor looked through his contacts. He needed to call Dennis back about that thing. His thumb scrolled - As, Bs, Cs, Ds - his thumb stopped at a familiar place. Dad.
</p>
<p>Victor felt a lump in his throat. The cancer took him five years ago. Victor’s sudden sadness was overcome by a growing curiosity - what if he called now? Without a second thought, he tapped the screen and held the phone to his ear. It rang. It rang again. And again. And again. Then -
</p>
<p>“He-hello?"
</p>
<p>Victor jumped. “Hi…this used to be my dad’s number."
</p>
<p>“Wh-who is this?"
</p>
<p>“My name’s Victor. Sorry to bother you. I was just… I wanted to talk to someone. What’s your name?"
</p>
<p>“Liam. Cohen. Um… why are you calling your dad’s old number? "
</p>
<p>“I don’t really know. He passed away five years ago. Thought I’d see who has the number now. But I realize this must be really awkward for you…"
</p>
<p>“Yeah… don’t really know what to tell you, man."
</p>
<p>“You don’t need to say anything. I just needed to hear a voice. Thank you."
</p>
<p>“Uh…sure. Sure."
</p>
<p>“Well, goodbye."
</p>
<p>Victor smiled. He rubbed his red eyes. He called Dennis.
</p>
<p>---
</p>
<p>A man stood at the side of the Golden Gate, looking down at the white caps a hundred feet below. They looked so inviting. He straddled the fence and dropped to the other side. There was nothing stopping him now. Nothing between himself and a sweet end. He closed his eyes.
</p>
<p>RING! He opened his eyes.
</p>
<p>RING! He pulled out his phone.
</p>
<p>RING! He didn’t recognize the number.
</p>
<p>RING!
</p>
<p>“He-hello?"
</p>
<p>“Hi…this used to be my dad’s number."
</p>
<p>---
</p>
<p>Minutes crawled by. The man hung up. He stared at his phone for a very long time. Then slowly, he climbed back over the fence and walked back home.
