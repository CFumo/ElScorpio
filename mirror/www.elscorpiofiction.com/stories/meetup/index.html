		<div id='text'><p><p>The last time I saw Myra was 372 days ago. Approximately. But who's counting? It was hard to forget because it was Valentine’s Day when she broke my heart. Though I probably broke hers too. I'd assumed she lost my number, maybe even moved out of town. Until she left a message for me a week ago urgently asking to meet with me. Well the real message sounded light hearted and chatty - “Just thought we could meet for coffee!” - but there's something about being with someone for a year and four months that just makes you know.
</p>
<p>Through a drawn out game of phone tag, we agreed to meet here. I'd accounted for her usual tardiness and still I was sitting alone sipping my coffee and trying not to make eye contact with the couple eyeing my table.
</p>
<p>“So sorry I'm late!” Her voice fluttered from behind me. Myra looked up at me expectantly and I stood up to give her a hug. “My god, Darren, you're a giant!”
</p>
<p>I tried to make a joke to cover up how flustered her familiar smell made me. She left to order - a chai latte, her usual - before joining me again. Her face wasn't quite as pretty as I remembered and I felt a sense of relief. We launched into small talk that was simultaneously comfortable and strained.
</p>
<p>After an awful joke I made - through which she humored me with a laugh - she lightly touched my hand, as if to steady herself. “I don't know if you remember-I had this ring, a ruby one, and I think I left it at your place. I wanted to get it if you still have it.”
</p>
<p>I vaguely remembered stashing it away in the back of my desk. Or was it my dresser? “Now?” I asked, surprised.
</p>
<p>“Well I came by your place about a month after we broke up but I saw you walking up to your door with a girl on your arm.” She smiled, wryly. “Didn't want to ruin the mood.”
</p>
<p>“Ah.” I sat there awkwardly. “Yeah, sure, I'll look around for it.”
</p>
<p>“Thanks.” Myra looked relieved. “If you could get it to me by noon tomorrow that would be great.”
</p>
<p>I raised my eyebrows. “Uhh that's soon.” She looked uncomfortable. I couldn't help my curiosity. “Any particular reason?”
</p>
<p>She paused, before looking me in the eye. “It's a matching set, with me, my mom, and Lissa. Lissa wants us to wear them when we put mom in the ground.”
</p>
<p>I stared at her, at a loss for words. “I, uh, sorry. That sucks. I don't know what to say.”
</p>
<p>She snorted. “Wasn't that always the problem?” Her voice was low, as if she didn't mean for me to hear it.
</p>
<p>“Hey, if you want to talk, I'm here-”
</p>
<p>“Nope!” She took the last gulp from her cup. “That's all. If you could leave it in your mailbox I'll come get it from you tomorrow.” Before I could say anything she gave me a quick kiss on the cheek. And then she was gone.
