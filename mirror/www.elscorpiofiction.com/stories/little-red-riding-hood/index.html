		<div id='text'><p><p><em>Prompt:
	</em>
</p>
<p><em>Re-imagine the classic story of Little Red Riding Hood in the style of Hard Science Fiction + Crime</em>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Once upon a specific point in the space-time continuum there was a human child who lived in an orbital habitat that circled a small blue planet at just over of 3 kilometers per second. The habitat kept to an altitude of 22 thousand kilometers which allowed it to maintain a geosynchronous orbit above a particular point on this planet. For this reason, the child was called Little Red Riding Hood.<br><br>Now, upon this specific point, this human child said to her parent. "First order ancestor, I wish to temporarily co-locate with my ancestor of higher order on the surface, for they are aged and nearing death."<br><br>To which the parent replied, "I will allow this, go but be cautious on your trip to the surface. Do not look overlong out the portal of the drop shuttle, for space is vast and incomprehensible."<br><br>"Noted.", replied the girl.<br><br>Little Red Riding Hood left her family's assigned dormitory and navigated to the shuttle bay. Upon arrival a nearby intercom crackled and a tinny voice announced, "Next shuttle drop in 4 minutes, please board presently."<br><br>Little Red Riding Hood boarded the shuttle and took a seat by a portal.<br><br>"I will not look overlong. I will just steal the occasional glance. That is all, nothing more.", she told herself.<br><br>The view out the portal was of the hanger bay. She could see the other drop shuttles which sprouted from the walls in strange bouquets of wire and life support systems. With a lurch her shuttle was released from the habitat and withdrew from the enclosure. As the shuttle began its descent, the view of the hanger bay receded and gave way to the dark field of stars beyond.<br><br>Little Red Riding Hood pressed her face greedily against the window and stared.
</p>
<p>And stared.
</p>
<p>
	<br>And stared.
</p>
<p><br><br>She watched the habitat shrink to the size of the smallest pin prick in the distance. And smaller still and soon she lost the habitat entirely in the overwhelming blanket of stars.
</p>
<p><br><br>As she stared, Little Red Riding Hood whispered into the plexiglass window that separated her from the cold embrace of space.
</p>
<p><br><br>"My, how many stars you have."
</p>
<p><br><br>And after a long stretch of silence, she heard a reply, "The better to demonstrate your insignificance. You are one of billions orbiting a star which itself is one of uncountably many. Nothing you can do or know can compare to the utter scale of the universe."
</p>
<p><br><br>"My, how vast and empty the spaces between."
</p>
<p><br><br>The reply came quicker this time, "The better to show you how truly alone you are. Everywhere you look there are stars, but these visions you see are only the imperfect echoes of an unknowable past carried by light that has traveled for longer than the length of your life to reach your eyes."
</p>
<p><br><br>Shaken, the child replied, "I have heard of the observer effect whereby the act of observing a phenomena necessarily acts upon and changes said phenomena. But I wonder, what of the inverse, whereby one through the act observing a thing is necessarily and irrevocably changed by it in its image.
</p>
<p><br><br>I have looked out into the void, and the void has not looked back, but instead through my eyes, looked out upon itself. I am become an infinitely recursing mirror, reflecting a sad lonely truth back upon myself, forever."
</p>
<p><br><br>With this, the shuttle landed and the child disembarked and walked through a forest to her grandmother's house.
</p>
<p><br><br>She knocked three times upon her grandmother's door and after a moment an elderly woman greeted her. Little Red Riding Hood stood and looked upon her grandmother and saw there a future version of herself worn thin by age and experience. And the girl could not look upon the face of her grandmother and help but to see her own, and in her own reflected back, that same sad lonely truth.
</p>
<p><br><br>And so in acceptance of this truth, Little Red Riding Hood cooked and ate her grandmother. She consumed first one half, and then half the remainder in half again the time. And in this fashion Little Red Riding Hood continued, a generational ouroborus, moving through an infinity of steps in a finite period of time, happily ever after.
</p>
<p>The End.
