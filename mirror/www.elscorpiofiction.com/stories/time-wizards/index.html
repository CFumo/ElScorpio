		<div id='text'><p><p>Zardon the Secret and Kedelfex the Bombast were convened in the highest room of Zardon's tower, along with Nelial the elf, Thordin the dwarf, Shgala the orc, and the two humans, Idris and Iclea. Zardon and Kedeflex were historically bitter rivals, and it had taken an incredible feat of diplomacy to finally wed their powers over a common goal. The mission: defeat the Dark Lord Azaroth once and for all. The method: time travel.
</p>
<p>"But why travel forward?" asked Thordin. "Why not back in time, to stop his reign in its infancy?" There was some muttered agreement from the others assembled.
</p>
<p>"Because," said Kedeflex, casting a weary look to Zardon. Once they'd put their hostilities to bed, the rival wizards had discovered that they actually had much in common. "The past no longer exists. And the future doesn't exist yet. In reality, you will not be travelling so much as freezing in place while the rest of time moves about you."
</p>
<p>Zardon stepped forward. "Need we remind you that once you go, you can never return?"
</p>
<p>The party fell into a heavy but determined silence.
</p>
<p>"When you arrive," continued Kedeflex, "you'll be very small. Remember, this is because the universe is slowly expanding. When you travel, your current size will be preserved, but everything else will have grown around you. You'll also be denser by comparison, so it will take more energy to moveâ€¦ No no, you don't have to understand it, just remember: small, dense. Like a couple of very heavy rats." He smiled slightly as he imagined it.
</p>
<p>"By then Azaroth will have driven us from the tower and taken up residence here," said Zardon, "but this floor will be unoccupied, so you'll be free to regroup when you re-enter the timeline. Do you still have the poisoned needles?"
</p>
<p>Nelial held up the little wooden case.
</p>
<p>"Won't the needles shrink too?" asked Shgala.
</p>
<p>"Yes," said Kedeflex, "but ultimately that will be to your advantage. Remember, we have seen the outcome of this mission." He touched his fingers to his temples theatrically. "It will be trying, but the Dark Lord will be vanquished. So take heart, heroes."
</p>
<p>The party stepped into the magic circle drawn in chalk on the floorboards. They joined hands and ducked their heads as the wizards stretched up to touch their wands together over the circle. In a flash of light, the heroes were gone.
