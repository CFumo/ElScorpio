		<div id='text'><p><p>By noon, Cosmo had nearly reached the old Jimstown Mill clearing. Through the gaps in the trees came glimpses of something white and luminescent. When he finally broke into the clearing, Cosmo saw a beautiful, snow-white mare standing in the shade of the apple tree. No… Not a mare…
</p>
<p>“A unicorn!” said Cosmo with delight. He carefully and reverently approached her, holding out his hand for her to sniff. He laughed as her whispering lips tickled his palm.
</p>
<p>“Hey there, girl,” he said, stroking her velvet nose. What a remarkable creature! As he patted her neck, his attention skipped between her silk-soft, thickly flowing mane; the pearlescent sparkle of her spiral horn; her mesmerizing jewel-dark eye. Her lips found his face, and he laughed again as she licked his cheek, tasting the sweat and salt of his skin. When her tongue ran along the outside edge of his ear, he was shocked to feel a jolt of desire shoot through him.
</p>
<p>Cosmo clung to the unicorn’s neck as she lapped at his throat and collarbone. He was suddenly wild with lust. He tore at his clothing, desperate to offer more of his flesh to her sweet tongue. Before long he was lying naked in the shade and the dry grass, weak under her ministrations, urging her on in whispers.
</p>
<p>Lower and lower went her tongue, and above him the unicorn began to change. Long, creeping limbs unfurled themselves from her underbelly. She ran nine-fingered hands along his sides, raking him with her claws, then caressing the long red welts. He groaned and rolled his head back as she took him into her moist, hot mouth, her velvet tongue tasting, stroking, maddening him. The tip of her horn gently scraped his stomach with each bob of her head, and he bucked his hips to increase the contact.
</p>
<p>He opened his eyes to watch her suckle him. Two of her other heads were raised, and with eerie, choir-like voices, they sang hymns from books suspended before them. The ground thundered under hundreds of pawing hooves. Her blurred-black wings rose infinitely into the sky, twin towers of shivering feathers and shadow.
</p>
<p>He closed his eyes. Pretended he didn’t see. Didn’t care. Some other appendage had entered him from behind, and the feeling was exquisite and excruciating. He could no longer tell pleasure from torture. The space around him seemed to streeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetch, time seemed to sloooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwww doooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwn. Reality was breaking down. Was her mouth still on him? He couldn’t tell. He raised his head to see, but he could no longer distinguish his body from the dirt. He reached out to feel but he didn’t have a hand anymore.
