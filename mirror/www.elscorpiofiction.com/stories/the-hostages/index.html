		<div id='text'><p><p>There was like, this guy. Sam? I don’t care. Samuel, fuck. He was a cop and he’s one of those guys that can read minds, and also talk to you in your mind. And this one time he and his partner are dealing with this hostage situation in a warehouse, but his partner gets separated (David), and they’re at opposite ends of the warehouse trying to get to each other.
</p>
<p>Sam thought to David, “Do you know where the hostages are?”
</p>
<p>David, who had a normal brain, thought something, I forget, but it was about the hostage location. Sam rounded a corner, pulled out his gun and shot two robbers. Then he picked up the bag of flour.
</p>
<p>Sam then thought-asked about the leader of the robbers. “David, do you know where the leader is? Then he sniped another robber, who was up in the rafters. The henchman fell with a cry and splattered on the concrete floor, blood and guts splattering everywhere.
</p>
<p>The twist is, the leader of the bad guys, Gustavo, is also a mind-reader.
</p>
<p>“Do you know where the hostages are?” he thought to David, but David couldn’t tell who was who because all telepath voices sound the fucking same.
</p>
<p>Then David was like, “You already asked me that dickweed,” he thought to Sam.
</p>
<p>“What the fuck are you talking about?” Sam thought to David, turning into the next aisle.
</p>
<p>At this point Gustavo started killing the hostages, but that’s pretty irrelevant. David thinks, “You just asked me the same question you asked five minutes ago.
</p>
<p>“No I didn’t,” thought Sam. He was staring at staring at all the different milk brands. And that’s when the robbers broke in.
</p>
<p>“Heads down motherfuckers!” screamed a robber, and sent a machine gun spray across the checkout stands and over the meat counter, spraying blood and raw meat all over the wall. Blood and guts splattered everywhere.
</p>
<p>David was in the next aisle over, but I forget what he was doing. He wasn’t killed. He thought, “Oh my god Sam are you ok?”
</p>
<p>Sam was like, “Holy shit.” Her basket slipped out of her hand, and the carton of eggs broke all over the floor.
</p>
<p>That’s when Sam got up and grabbed the gun that she dropped. She snuck up behind one of the robbers and asked him something like “where are the fucking hostages.” Really menacing sounding.
