		<div id='text'><p><p>It’s finally happening.
</p>
<p>Tonight’s the night.
</p>
<p>Oh my God.
</p>
<p>Literally.
</p>
<p>It’s such a weird idea. I’m dating God. No, it’s not some man I’m putting on a pedestal, believing him to be so perfect that I’d call him “a god.” I’m dating the honest-to-fucking-goodness Second Coming.
</p>
<p>People didn’t believe Him. Some Samoan guy from West Virginia just pops out of nowhere and declares He’s the fucking Almighty One Himself. I didn’t even know there were Samoans in West Virginia. Maybe that was the first miraculous sign we should have payed attention to?
</p>
<p>But there He was, this beautiful, 250 pound man, preaching of love and curing the sick on the street. People called Him everything: A lunatic, a heretic, just another crazy person. Then He turned water into wine. And then He turned the wine into bourbon because that’s more His style.
</p>
<p>I just wanted to see what all the hubbub was about. So I went to go check out what He had to say when He was in my town. He made eye contact with me during the sermon. His smile made me blush, but His sermon was so powerful I couldn’t look away. Once He had multiplied a few loaves of bread and some chicken (they were out of fish) to feed the thousands present that day, He walked right over to me and introduced himself. A few minutes into chatting, He asked me on a date. When God Himself asks you on a date, YOU DON’T FUCKING SAY NO. But when you’re still trying to deal with your images of white Jesus on the cross being crushed by a large Samoan man, things get even more complicated when you’re confronted by God asking you on a gay date. Part of me still thinks this whole thing is just to show some of those crazy Baptists or something how wrong they were about homosexuals. Maybe I’m just projecting…
</p>
<p>The first two dates were fantastic. A couple lovely dinners and some really great conversation. You don’t know how great a first kiss can be until you’ve had it on the middle of a lake with a man who can walk on water.
</p>
<p>But tonight He’s coming over to my place.
</p>
<p>God smiled at me and asked if I wanted to “Netflix and chill.” He knows our memes.
</p>
<p>I’ve literally spent the last ten hours just cleaning my apartment. It’s more IMMACULATE than I ever could have CONCEIVED.
</p>
<p>Sorry, I make puns when I’m nervous.
</p>
<p>This is going to be the best sex of my life.
</p>
<p>Really. How do you top God?
</p>
<p>Wait, I guess I mean that both ways… Is God a top? Well, if He’s God, he’s probably versatile? Shit, how does this work? I can’t figure this out on Grindr, now I need to go read subtext in the Bible?
</p>
<p>He’s perfect. That means this sex is going to be perfect. Wait, how do I live up to that? How do you compare yourself to that? Can I really pleasure an all powerful being? I guess He’s in a fully human form, so the possibility is there, but how do you measure up? Maybe in His love he just gets off from pleasuring others? Wait, so maybe He is a bottom?
</p>
<p>I wonder how big His dick is. It has to be huge, right? What if it’s so big it hurts? No, then the sex wouldn’t be perfect, and this is GOD we’re talking about. So I guess it would just be average? But wouldn’t it be weird to have a dick bigger than God’s? Maybe it’s a certain size during some things, and a different size during others? Can God change His dick size?
</p>
<p>What if things don’t work out between us? I will never have sex this good again. I can’t measure up to Him, and then nobody else ever will either.
</p>
<p>Maybe He was kidding and we won’t even have sex. He probably just wants to come over to cuddle and watch a movie and talk more. This is just me being too human. I made this so dirty, why does my mind always go there first. I should just focus on enjoying the night and His company. I can’t go into this with expectations. There’s probably a lesson here.
</p>
<p>..I should douche...
