		<div id='text'><p><p>Dr. Klaas Wilders was a grey-haired, dry-humored man who specialized in physician-assistedsuicides. One day he was approached by a man named Simon. Simon claimed to be an immortal who had lived for hundreds of years, and wanted Wilders to help him die. Wilders initially wrote the man off as a lunatic, but was swayed by an exorbitant bribe.
</p>
<p>The standard succession of Pavulon and potassium chloride didn't work. Midazolam also proved ineffective, as well as the classic but barbaric pentobarbital. With mounting wonder, Wilders produced a whole series of diabolical cocktails, which his patient endured with wan amusement, but it seemed Simon could not be killed by injection.
</p>
<p>Simon's expectations were met too well for disappointment. He confessed to attempting countless methods of suicide, from gruesome to mundane, with no luck. As a demonstration— "and for your amusement, doctor," he said—Simon spent the next few nights slitting his own throat, shooting himself with a revolver, and leaping from a third-story balcony, all before the doctor's disbelieving eyes, and recovering miraculously from each injury.
</p>
<p>Wilders was hard-pressed to contain his professional curiosity—he was dealing with a medical marvel—but he was of course being paid for discretion. And above all his goal was to help the man die. Simon couldn't remember when and how he'd contracted his "illness," and in fact had very few memories from his early life. One of his few clear recollections was this poem:
</p>
<p>No peace to find, no rest to take
</p>
<p>Until you've let the dreamer wake
</p>
<p>Nonsense to Simon, but a clue to the doctor. Wilders suggested searching through the family heirlooms Simon kept in one of his country villas, a collection of old maps and crumbling tomes. The investigation was moving well outside the doctor's area of expertise, but supported by Simon's inexhaustible wealth, they could scour the material at their leisure.
</p>
<p>Slowly, they pieced together a history of unmet prophecies and weird magic that, before meeting Simon, Wilders would have scarcely been able to credit. He seemed to enter a separate, dream-like reality, where Cain still fled beneath the mark of his sin, and Merlin could sleep in the oak for a thousand years. Simon's fate was tied to that of an ancient lord or king buried under the Alps, and he could only die by giving his soul to revive the corpse of the king. A sinister foreboding accompanied every mention of the black monarch, but Wilders brushed his unease aside as easily as his old Harvard skepticism. He was too enthralled in Simon's mysteries, too touched by his wry, hollow-eyed exhaustion.
</p>
<p>They stayed with some poor mountain farmers while they prepared for their excursion. With open mistrust, the wrinkled peasant woman asked Wilders if he had never heard the expression "let sleeping dogs lie." At the tomb's entrance, Simon said, "You can still turn back, doctor."
</p>
<p>"I would see you happily dead," said Wilders, and Simon's answering smile would have charmed him into worse hells than that brooding gloom. Long descents lead them into a vaulted chamber guarded by the statue of a horned behemoth. At one end was a basalt coffin, and at the other a granite altar, which Simon mounted. "Here I become mortal," he said, and even as his color drained and voice faded, the black air behind them warmed and seethed. The doctor held his hand. He closed his eyes, and breathed his last sigh. Simon finally slept, but something else was awake in the dark.
