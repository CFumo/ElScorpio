		<div id='text'><p><p>The man, calling himself "mattystone49", promised her 3000 tokens "in the next 48 hours." He had earlier expressed that she was "too good for this sort of stuff." He expressed to her how much he loved the way she stroked her pussy and she proved how wet she had become by lifting her hand to the camera to show her glistening index, ring and middle fingers. She announced she would be working for 16 hours tomorrow and the day after, which he was very glad about. He would be there the next day.
</p>
<p>On the next day mattystone49 had revised the terms to 1500 tokens "over 2 days, like we talked about".  He told her he was going out for a smoke. She asked if he could give them to her and she would prepare herself while he went for a smoke. Although it was never explicit, he did not seem very interested at this point in giving any tokens to this sweet girl, who definitely deserved better than stroking her pussy on cam to complete strangers. A little later he logged off. She tried to hide her disappointment. She logged off, defeated.
