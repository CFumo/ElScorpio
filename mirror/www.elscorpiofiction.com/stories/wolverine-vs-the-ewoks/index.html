		<div id='text'><p><p>“So, heh, you’re shoe… you’re sure we won’t be seeing Bruce?” asked Elaine, who was feeling more than a little buzzed after a long night of drinking.
</p>
<p>Alfred opened the door to Wayne Manor and explained; “Master Wayne will be running errands until much later tonight, madam, which means we will have the house to ourselves...” He smiled wryly, “...including the master bedroom.”
</p>
<p>Elaine giggled and ran her hand through Alfred’s hair as they stepped into the foyer. Alfred closed the door behind her and gestured toward a hallway on the left.
</p>
<p>“Might I suggest a quick trip to the kitchen for some of Master Bruce’s Cabernet?”
</p>
<p>Elaine raised an eyebrow and began to walk in that direction when there was a loud banging at the door. A frown flashed momentarily across Alfred’s face as he turned back to the door.
</p>
<p>“Sir or Madam! It is half past one in the morning! Would you kindly wait until tomorrow!”
</p>
<p>A muffled voice called back; it was Wolverine.
</p>
<p>“Alfred! Thank god! You gotta let me in man. Seriously, I need some fuckin’ help here.”
</p>
<p>Alfred stuck his head out the door to speak with Wolverine. Elaine tried to listen to their conversation but only caught pieces of it. She heard Alfred say “you can’t be serious” and then there was some quiet arguing, and then a few moments later “...seriously cockblocking me right now.” After that the door opened and Wolverine rushed in, looking utterly panicked. His shirt was nowhere to be found and he had cuts and scrapes all over his body. His claws were fully extended and covered in blood.
</p>
<p>“Okay, fuck… Shit. We gotta lock the doors, man. Board up all the windows. …And you guys should get some knives or something. Something… deadly.”
</p>
<p>“Elaine, this is my friend Logan. Logan, this is my <em>date </em>Elaine,” said Alfred. “Logan believes he is being hunted by a pack of teddy bears that speak chinese.”
</p>
<p>Wolverine retracted his claws, slammed the front door, and bolted it shut. “I know I know, it sounds FUCKIN’ crazy right? But it’s the goddamn truth! I was headed back from Jean’s place and these furry little shitheads dropped a tree on me. Maybe they confused me for someone else or something? I don’t fuckin’ know, man. But they all started screaming in what I <em>THINK </em>was chinese and throwing rocks and shit…“
</p>
<p>Elaine fell on the floor laughing.
</p>
<p>“...And at first I thought they were just some kids but then one of them <em>STABBED </em>me. With a fuckin’ knife, man! So I start fighting back… right? Like… who the fuck are you assholes anyway? I punched one of them really hard and …I don’t know… I might have killed that bastard…”
</p>
<p>Alfred put a calming hand on Wolverine’s shoulder but was brushed aside.
</p>
<p>“...Anyway, they all stopped for a second to mourn their little buddy and then shit just <em>jumped off</em>, man. They went into some kinda teddy bear blood rage. I’ve never seen such violence…”
</p>
<p>Wolverine’s eyes glazed over and he stared at the ground for a few seconds before continuing.
</p>
<p>“They make these fuckin’ traps, man. Like… little wooden lincoln log shit. But that shit <em>WORKS</em>. I barely made it here dude. I… oh shit… I think I hear them. Everybody shut the fuck up for a second…”
</p>
<p>Elaine rolled onto her back and—trying not to snort from laughter—listened for the teddy bears. After concentrating for a moment she noticed a faint whispering noise... but it was probably just the wind. There was a soft rustling sound just outside the front door. Then a floorboard creaked somewhere upstairs.
</p>
<p>“Oh, perhaps Master Bruce is home after all,” said Alfred, motioning toward the staircase.
</p>
<p>Wolverine grabbed his shoulder and shushed him.
</p>
<p><em>“Don’t move. I think they’re already in the fuckin’ house, man."</em>
</p>
<p><em></em>Alfred gave Elaine a sheepish look, as if to apologize for Wolverine’s behavior. The trio waited silently in the foyer for what seemed like minutes before Elaine decided she’d had enough.
</p>
<p>“Alright,” she said, standing up. “I think I’m done with this teddy bear nonsense for the evening. I’ll just be on my—”
</p>
<p>She was interrupted by the sound of a horn blaring at the top of the staircase and a cacophony of impish war cries erupting from all over the house. The front door was obliterated by a tumbling boulder and a horde of armed ewoks streamed in, screaming.
</p>
<p>“God damnit they found me!” screamed Wolverine. “Fuck you! Assholes!”
</p>
<p>“Holy fuck, they’re ewoks!” yelled Elaine, unsure of whether she should feel joy or terror.
</p>
<p>It looked like some kind of teddy bear levee had burst. The ewoks streamed in through the hole in the front door and down the stairs, waving crude knives and spears. Those that remained outside continued their war cry and began throwing rocks through the windows of the house.
</p>
<p>Wolverine acted quickly. He extended his claws and slashed open an incoming ewok, exposing its intestines and sending it cartwheeling back into its comrades. He dodged under a flying spear, kicked another ewok in the throat, and tipped a nearby bookcase onto three more of them. It landed with a thud and blood splattered out from under it. A tiny spear lodged itself squarely in Alfred’s shoulder. He stumbled and fell backward but Elaine caught him and pulled him into the hallway toward the kitchen.
</p>
<p>“You fuckin’ shitheads think you can take me!?” Wolverine screamed, panting.
</p>
<p>“This way!” yelled Elaine.
</p>
<p>As they ran toward the kitchen, Alfred pulled a hidden lever in the wall and a spiral staircase unfurled in the floor.
</p>
<p>“We must… take the Batmobile,” said Alfred, clutching his shoulder.
</p>
<p>Elaine made a fist pumping motion. “I fucking <em>knew it</em>!”
</p>
<p>The trio ducked into the staircase and locked the hatch just as a pair of massive logs crashed through the hallway, destroying it. The sound of ewoks digging frantically at the hatch and screaming reverberated through the staircase as they descended into the Batcave.
