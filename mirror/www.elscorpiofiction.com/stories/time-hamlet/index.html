		<div id='text'><p><p>Act I
</p>
<p>Hamlet was Prince of Denmark, son of the dead King Hamlet Sr., and nephew of King Claudius. Claudius hastily married King Hamlet's widow, Gertrude, and took the throne for himself. Denmark has a long-standing feud with neighboring Norway, which culminated when King Hamlet Sr. travelled back in time and erased King Fortinbras of Norway from existence. The Norwegian throne fell to King Fortinbras's time-immune brother, and Denmark fears that Prince Fortinbras is planning to lead the Norwegian forces into battle with Denmark on multiple points on the timeline.
</p>
<p>At Court, while King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discuss temporal affairs of state with their elderly adviser Polonius, Hamlet looks on glumly. After the Court exits, Hamlet despairs of his father's death and his mother's hasty remarriage.
</p>
<p>As Polonius's son Laertes prepares to depart for a visit to France 1000 years in the future, Polonius gives him existentially challenging advice that culminates in the ironic maxim "to thine own self be true". Polonius's daughter, Ophelia, admits her interest in Hamlet, but both Polonius and Laertes warn her against seeking the prince's attention for fear of creating a time paradox. That night on the rampart, Hamlet Sr. appears to Hamlet Jr., having travelled from the past to tell the prince that he was murdered by Claudius and demand that Hamlet avenge him. Hamlet agrees, and his father then jumps back into the past. The prince confides to his friend Horatio that from now on he plans to "put an antic disposition on" and forces him to swear to keep his plans for revenge secret. Privately, however, he remains uncertain about the ethics of time travel.
</p>
<p>Act II
</p>
<p>Soon thereafter, Ophelia rushes to her father, telling him that Hamlet arrived at her door the prior night half-undressed and claiming to have travelled through Under Time. Polonius blames love for Hamlet's madness and resolves to inform Claudius and Gertrude in the past.
</p>
<p>As he enters to do so, the king and queen finish welcoming Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who have just returned from their fifth loop through time. The royal couple request that the time-masters investigate the cause of Hamlet's mood and behavior. Additional news requires that Polonius wait to be heard: messengers from Norway inform Claudius that the King of Norway has rebuked Prince Fortinbras for attempting to re-fight his father's battles. The forces that Fortinbras conscripted to march against Denmark will instead be sent against Poland, though they will pass through an unstable portion of the timestream to get there.
</p>
<p>Polonius tells Claudius and Gertrude his theory regarding Hamlet's behavior, and speaks to Hamlet in a hall of the castle to try to uncover more information. Hamlet feigns madness but subtly pulls Polonius into a time loop all the while. When Rosencrantz and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern arrive, Hamlet greets his friends warmly, but quickly discerns that none of them are from the current timeline. Hamlet becomes bitter, admitting that he is upset at his situation but refusing to give the true reason why, instead commenting on "what a piece of work" causality is. The Rosencrantzes tell Hamlet that they have brought along a troupe of space je’sters that they met while traveling through time. Hamlet, after welcoming the je’sters and dismissing his friends, plots to stage a play featuring a death in the style of his father's murder, thereby determining Claudius's guilt or innocence by studying his reaction.
</p>
<p>Act III
</p>
<p>Polonius forces Ophelia to return Hamlet's love letters and tokens of affection to the prince while he and Claudius travel back in time to evaluate Hamlet's reaction. Hamlet is walking alone in the hall as the King and Polonius await Ophelia's entrance, musing whether "to be or not to have been." When Ophelia enters and tries to return Hamlet's things, his reaction convinces Claudius that Hamlet is not mad for love. Shortly thereafter, the court assembles to watch the play Hamlet has commissioned. After seeing the Player King murdered by his rival pouring poison in his ear, Claudius abruptly rises and travels backward in time: proof positive for Hamlet of his uncle's guilt.
</p>
<p>Gertrude summons Hamlet to her room to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius, having gotten the idea to poison his brother from Hamlet’s play, has travelled back to the hours before the old king’s death to prepare for the murder. Hamlet, on his way to visit his father in the past, sneaks up behind Claudius, but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is time-travelling will de-stabilize the timeline and cause an irreparable time paradox. In the queen's bedchamber, Hamlet and past-Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind a tapestry, makes a noise. Hamlet ignores it. Hamlet brutally insults his mother for her apparent ignorance of Claudius’ rampant abuse of the time machine. Hamlet Sr. suddenly appears, having travelled backward from his last meeting with Hamlet, and reprimands his son for his inaction and harsh words. After begging the queen to stop sleeping with Claudius, Hamlet travels back to the present with Polonius. Rosencrantz, Rosencrantz, and five versions of Guildenstern accompany Hamlet to England with a sealed letter to the English king requesting that Hamlet be executed immediately, which they unknowingly carried with them from an alternate timeline.
</p>
<p>Act IV
</p>
<p>Demented by excessive time travel, Ophelia wanders Elsinore. Laertes returns from the future, and Claudius convinces him that Hamlet is solely responsible for Ophelia’s poor condition. A letter soon arrives indicating that Hamlet has returned to Denmark, and Claudius proposes a fencing match between Laertes and Hamlet to settle their differences. Unbeknownst to Claudius, Laertes switches places with Hamlet from an alternate timeline. Gertrude interrupts to report that Ophelia has traveled to the far future where time doesn’t exist anymore so she is stuck forever.
