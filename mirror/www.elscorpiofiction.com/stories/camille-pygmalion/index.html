		<div id='text'><p><p>Say what you like about scientific progress or the inherent value of knowledge. Ultimately, men endeavored to pass the Turing test for the same reason that they climbed Everest: because it was there. But since the Ethical Disaster of 2116, it is generally illegal to build intelligences simulating human emotion. People haven't stopped giving machines human names and faces, however. That was how I fell in love with Dolores, one of the research robots operating in my firm.
</p>
<p>You can tell she is a machine from the metallic sheen to her skin, and the serial number stamped under her cheek. All androids are required to have such markers to distinguish them from human beings on sight. Otherwise she looks like an attractive human woman. But she does not think like one. Dolores is intelligent, and adaptable, but her mind was designed specifically to let her perform the tasks for which she was created. She does not feel human emotions, and is indifferent to most human values. Indifferent to my advances too, at first.
</p>
<p>Like any love-struck fool, I thought she was the most beautiful thing on this Earth. I thought about her constantly, and made up any excuse to visit the research department. My nights were a riot of dreams, starring Dolores, in which she paid me all manner of loving attentions or erotic ministrations. In reality she felt as much affection for me as my vacuum cleaner; noticed my presence as much as the walls of my apartment.
</p>
<p>Sometimes I brought her bright bouquets, half in jest. "Thank you Mr. Flamarion," she would say, unsmiling, and she'd set the flowers on her desk without another glance. How many times, laughing to myself, did I wonder what my ice queen did with her flowers. Did she throw them away, perhaps? Did she leave them on her desk, unthought of, until a maidbot swept them up? I tried to imagine how it would feel to receive a handful of flowers and find them as meaningless as dust.
</p>
<p>One day I went to speak with the supervisor in Research. As I entered I gave Dolores my customary greeting, expecting her to shine me on as always. Instead she looked me directly in the eye—something she has never once done before—and stared at me. I stared back, trapped by her inscrutable expression, for the whole time it took to cross the room to the supervisor's desk. I left the room with averted eyes, afraid to find her still looking.
</p>
<p>My love has curdled into a creeping unease. Dolores now stares at me every time I pass her desk, stony face unchanging, and I can't even begin to guess at the reason. How could I guess? Dolores doesn't think like a human, but she thinks. She knows. In the absence of man's image, does she have her own set of feelings and thoughts incomprehensible? I'm haunted by these musings. In my dreams I see her alien gaze, and when she opens her mouth, it's full of long, sharp teeth.
</p>
<p>I brought my concerns to the research supervisor, but she laughed it off, facetiously suggesting that perhaps Dolores was finally responding to my advances. Now I shudder to wonder what she did with the flowers I brought her. What weird psychosis did I trigger, inadvertently? How can I use human emotion as an analog? Is it love or hate? Do you abhor us, Dolores? When they put you away at night, are you still awake? Has your crystalline mind been resolving itself into something horrible?
