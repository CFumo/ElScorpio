		<div id='text'><p><p>Eugene awoke to the sound of his alarm at 5:15am. He rolled over to shut it off, gingerly propped himself up, and looked around the room. He stared for a long while, struggling to remember why he was supposed to wake up so early. His clouded thoughts wouldn’t coalesce into anything useful. Eventually he tossed his blanket off and cringed as the crisp morning air washed over him. It was still dark outside.
</p>
<p>He struck a match and lit a candle on his nightstand, then picked it up and shambled toward the bathroom. The soft light played strangely off of the walls and made the far end of the hallway look like a gaping black void, but Eugene preferred that over the uncompromising duality of the fluorescent lights and their switches. He placed the candle on the bathroom counter and stared at his complement in the mirror. The light gave him an eerie countenance. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
</p>
<p>“Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary,” he said, and then reluctantly reopened his eyes.
</p>
<p>The entity resembled the corpse of a naked woman. Pale blue skin hung loosely over its rotting frame and a pair of hollow eyes stared out from two sunken black pits in its face. It stood hunched in the darkest corner of the room, head cocked to one side, barely illuminated by the flickering candlelight. It was only visible in the mirror, though Eugene knew it was just as real as he. He picked up a container of floss and began wrapping some around his fingers.
</p>
<p>“Good morning Mary.”
</p>
<p>The corpse stared back at Eugene. Blood dripped from its mouth and a gash in its neck, splattering softly on the ground. Mary never said much, but her presence was comforting all the same. Eugene threaded the floss through his teeth for a while and then spit in the sink. When he looked back into the mirror Mary was standing directly behind him, mouth agape in a look of ghoulish agony. She looked particularly dead this morning.
</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry,” said Eugene, handing her a toothbrush.
</p>
<p>Mary’s reflection extended its cold, rotting hand and slowly retrieved the toothbrush, which continued to levitate in front of Eugene’s shoulder until he squeezed some toothpaste onto it. He smiled.
</p>
<p>“I’m really glad that you’ve decided to start brushing again.”
</p>
<p>The entity lifted the toothbrush to its faded green teeth and started brushing. The toothbrush went deeper than it had any right to. Rotting gums ripped away from their teeth as if they had never even been attached. Black, coagulated blood seeped out of Mary’s face and covered her hand. Her dead eyes stayed fixated on Eugene.
</p>
<p>Eugene finished brushing, spit once again into the sink, and stepped aside to give Mary some room. She leaned over the sink and released a conflagration of horrors from somewhere deep within. Blood, hair, and rotting viscera splattered over the counter and clogged the drain instantly, but Eugene didn’t mind since it was only the reflection of his sink that was affected. He picked up the candle and waited for Mary to finish.
</p>
<p>“Hey, I’d love to stay and chat for a while but I have to get to work early this morning. I have a meeting at seven. I’ll see you tonight though?”
</p>
<p>Mary glared at Eugene. He blew out the candle and left, closing the door behind him.
