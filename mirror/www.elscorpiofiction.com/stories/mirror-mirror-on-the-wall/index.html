		<div id='text'><p><p>“Hmm getting kind of pudgy, I see.” “You might want to rethink all that soda.” “Or run! Running is good for you.”
</p>
<p>This really was the worst fucking mirror.
</p>
<p>Liz preferred the cheap one she’d had in her old room, although that one had been a bit distorted (“Damn girl, look at that 2-pack! How’d you do that without working out?!” “You’ve got legs for DAYS!”). The one at school was okay too (“It’s hard to see ya in this dim lighting but ya look fine.” “Smile a little. Day’s almost over!”).
</p>
<p>Really, the best one was at Kay’s house - the full length one that flattered, but didn’t lie. “Those shorts look nice. But before you go out, you may want to powder your nose.”
</p>
<p>Every morning though, Liz was stuck looking at this one. “That’s an interesting eyeshadow choice.” “Don’t frown so much. You’re starting to get wrinkles.” If she didn’t need it to wash her face and do her hair, she’d probably avoid it altogether. “Wow. WOW! Now that’s a zit!” “Poof, poof, you sure you can’t make it poofier?”
</p>
<p>Liz tried to ignore it (“Just because you’re not looking, doesn’t make you any prettier!”), but recently she’d picked up the habit of talking back (“Ooh, girl’s got a temper. Better not let the boys see that face."). She hated to admit it, but it was really starting to grate on her.
</p>
<p>***
</p>
<p>It was at 6:37 on a cloudy, but otherwise unremarkable morning, when Officer Young showed up to a quiet suburban house, to find a frantic mother speckled in blood. “Lizzy! Will she be alright?” The woman clutched the arm of an EMT as she strapped in a... body. (Officer Young did a double take to confirm that the wet red cloth on the gurney did, indeed, hold a body). “Everything’s fine, Mom,” the rags rasped, “the mirror is gone.”
