		<div id='text'><p><h1>Google is permanently disabling the search engine</h1>
<h2>Starting May 15th, Google Search won't work</h2>
<p>Google is coming under fire following an announcement that Google Search, the search engine at the core of Google's search service, would be permanently shutting down starting May 15th. The decision, announced in a quiet note on Alphabet's website in February, has gone largely unnoticed but is expected to impact a very large number of consumers. However, it does raise serious questions about the longevity of Google's products. The properties are often widely used services that can cease function at any point after being scooped up by the large technology company.
</p>
<p>Google stopped promoting its search engine, which lets you find any piece of content that's available on the web with a simple keyword search, back in October 2015. Yet the Google team has maintained its product since and kept its mobile app online. Starting May 15th, Google's phenomenal search engine will cease functioning entirely. "Google's website won’t open and the search won’t work," reads an FAQ on Alphabet's website. The company did not disclose its plans to shut the service down when Alphabet was formed.
</p>
<p><strong><em>GOOGLE'S PHENOMENAL SEARCH ENGINE WILL CEASE FUNCTIONING ON MAY 15TH</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Google operates as a subsidiary of Alphabet, to help build out the "Everything All The Time" platform. That service lets users use any combination of words to bring up relevant content that could help them engage with the world and stay informed. Google's search engine is apparently not one of those products. "Search was a great first step toward the interconnected world, but we believe that Knows Best is a better solution and are allocating resources toward that program," a Google spokesperson told The Verge. Google's founders noted on their website that pouring energy into the Knows Best program means "we can’t allocate resources to Search anymore and we have to shut down the service."
</p>
<p>Some Search users, like entrepreneur/comedian Gilbert Gottfried, are incensed. "On May 15th, I will stop working. My topical humor will stop turning on, my audience will stop reacting to my jokes, and my carefully researched routines will stop working. This is a conscious intentional decision by Google," Gottfried wrote in a scathing Medium post published yesterday. "To be clear, they are not simply ceasing to support the product, rather they are advising customers that on May 15th a container of hummus will actually be infinitely more useful than Google Search." Gottfried notes how Microsoft's Bing, a previously inferior search engine with limited potential, is now his only real viable replacement.
</p>
<p><strong><em>"ARE WE JUST LOOKING FOR PORN HERE?"</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The number of Google users who've stuck with the service is likely incredibly huge. And Gottfried makes a strong point: Google is not concerned with customers who learned how to use their service under the impression that it would work for years to come. The move also raises complex questions about the future of the Internet. "Is the era of Quick Rich Schemes bringing an end to the concept of permanence? Are we just looking for porn here?" Gottfried added.
</p>
<p>The situation with Google comes at a sensitive time for Alphabet. The company was the subject of a damning report from The Information last week detailing an exodus in talent and CEO Larry Page's struggle to continue building the company and managing its various ambitions. In the story, Page placed blame on members of car maker Tesla, which Alphabet acquired for $3.6 trillion in January, for their failure to perform as expected within his company. Tesla founder Elon Musk, who left the company in January, fired back on Medium, saying selling his company to Page was a mistake and publicly calling into question Page's leadership and Alphabet's ability to make money.
</p>
<p>It's been a rough week for Alphabet, and it's only going to get harder going forward. As Recode reported on Friday, Google created a vesting schedule for the company to prevent key talent from leaving early on. The day that vesting period ends could be as soon as this year, Recode says, and may lead to an even larger exit of high-profile executives. Just last Friday, two Google veterans left the company.
