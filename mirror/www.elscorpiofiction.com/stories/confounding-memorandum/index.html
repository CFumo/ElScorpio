		<div id='text'><p><p>Richard stooped over his deceased brother’s desk. The candlelit smattering of handwritten notes covered the vastness of the blood-stained mahogany. A large, flesh-bound tome lay splayed- obscenely flaunting its secrets to the grieving man.
</p>
<p>“grommel trouth brutun gimledeld fieratuel brimsmi”
</p>
<p>The first line of a new page. Richard had puzzled over the book for hours- countless images and scribbles that appeared to be words in an unknowable language. This inked line, however, was finally something that Richard could fathom. Spoken aloud, it had a distinctly Germanic feel with a hint of Hindi. Richard knew not why, but the icy sensation of fear punctuated the unintelligible words.
</p>
<p>For what purpose had Benjamin sent out the puzzling missive- urging Richard to leave England post-haste and come to the brothers’ old office? The sickening tome, smelling faintly of human bile and shit, was the centerpiece of Ben’s rambling and error-filled postscript.
</p>
<p>“The BOOK...ou must… read… BOOK of LIES… read… BOOK of LIES and DREAMS.”
</p>
<p>A chilling dispatch of an otherwise eloquent man. Benjamin was not one to write when partaking in ether. Perhaps this was truly written before his death; the doctor said Benjamin’s brain was hemorrhaged beyond belief. If that was the case, how could he have signed, sealed, and mailed the letter? Questions upon questions.
</p>
<p>Richard read on.
</p>
<p>“escaliponi briansinsol kolichnikivechno estrep grommel”
</p>
<p>More wracking fear accompanying a jolt of cranial pain. “The book killed my brother,” Richard entertained the thought, “reading the words killed Benjamin.”
</p>
<p>Smiling sadly, Richard shook his head. An embarrassing thought, tantamount to a child’s nightmare gibber. The pain was perfectly reasonable- a result of heartfelt crying and not drinking enough water.
</p>
<p>Getting back to the line he just uttered, Richard took note of Russian and Italian flavors of the enigmatic words. If it wasn’t for the sheer size of the heavy book- well over two thousand pages- he would have written off the scribbles as children’s games.
</p>
<p>“brotomiser sansasan grommel etiango chilchidani”
</p>
<p>Had he even planned to read that? His vision was hazy, as if waking from deep sleep. Richard recalled thinking about the size of the foul book, but not the letter he seemed to have started to write. A letter with Richard’s handwriting, addressed to his beloved sister, Elena.
</p>
<p>Dearest Elena! Richard gasped loudly- a drowning man sucking in sweet air. He didn’t know what was happening, but a dim flicker of understanding tickled his mind. Taking up the freshly used quill, the same writing tool used by Benjamin before his death, Richard frantically wrote. A post-script interspersed with tears of frustration and sorrow. Tears of blood, welling from the ravaged brain within.
</p>
<p>Richard last heard himself screaming new words with no known meaning and his life flickered out of existence.
