		<div id='text'><p><p>Lovísa laid in a chaise lounge on the beach of Lake Kiva, trying her hardest to luxuriously relax with a cheap romance. A fragrant summer breeze rolled over the Lunar resort, lulling the world’s richest tourists. It was hard for Lovísa not to feel a little on edge, though. Yachts of variously pleasing designs languorously crossed the artificial lake. In the distance, jets flew in formation leaving thick dark contrails. The sky needed constant maintenance to keep Lunarians and visitors safe.
</p>
<p>A helicopter screamed into view above the resort, confirming Lovísa’s suspicion. “That was a short one,” she thought. Casually she threw the book on the ground and sat up to find her shirt. In the parking lot of the hotel, three men walked out of the helicopter and made their way into the hotel. Before they could announce their presence and intent to the reception Lovísa called as soon as she eyed them across the giant marbled hall: “Marcus!” she exclaimed and waved. They waited while she jogged across the giant gilded hall.
</p>
<p>Marcus suppressed a yawn, “So, how did you know we were looking for you? Tempo tricks aren’t allowed here, you know.” “You’re joking.” “No.” “Your helicopter. It’s the loudest blasted thing in the entire world.” “Right. Anyway,” he started and stalled.
</p>
<p>Marcus began shuffling, prompting Lovísa to ask if she should join them. Marcus stopped to yawn, as did one of his two bodyguards. “Of course. A new case opened. It’s a pretty urgent matter.” Lovísa shuffled up to Marcus’s side, “It’s not like, your mother, or something?” “No, we’re sure we’ve found all the tendrils of that line. Still amazed she kept her job. Listen, we’re not here for–” Marcus yawned again. He steadied himself on the reception’s desk. “-for that. We need you in Bravo.” “Bravo? I’m not sure if I–” “Lovísa. I don’t know if Bravo will survive.” “Bravo? How will a whole city ‘not survive’? What’s going on?” “Well, we think it’s a few local shiftings.” “That’s all? You can’t handle some shifts?” “Lovísa. You’re the one doing it.” “So kill me.” Marcus cringed. “How long have you been on the force?” She smiled. “Well, you’re well aware we can’t kill the criminal baby.” “Still think you should.” “Oh, hush.” The receptionist blinked.
</p>
<p>The National Office of Temporal Management is mainly engaged in fighting global time crime across the Solar System. The agency also handles all temporal deviations, licenses practitioners and attempts to maintain secrecy, both of itself and time travel, in the utmost. A century of time travel has now mostly seen minor issues. Their most complex case involved the criminal use of time travel in a coup attempt on Cameroon’s rulers. The office’s quick handling averted major disaster and Cameroon still thrives under the stable governance of the benevolent Biya dynasty. But with the increasing availability of apparatuses that afford any adequate agent and accomplice the ability to alter the α-line, the future of time travel is all but uncertain.
</p>
<p>They touched down in the eternal twilight of Bravo. The second settlement on the Moon, it was built up as an industrial base for the nascent Lunar civilisation but over the decades has fallen into blight as industry found other venues for operations. The city will likely never recover its boom, but the Moon’s largest artificial natural water reserves will keep its declining into stagnating population from fleeing entirely.
</p>
<p>Unease crept over Lovísa as she looked around. “It’s just a hobo,” Marcus appeased. She hadn’t noticed her. “It’s not that. Why are we so close to the scene? I really don’t want to have to pop lines right from the get-go.” “Yeah, look, you’ve managed to set up through the entire city.” “In two days?” “Yeah, the whole cluster is shifted back and forth. I’m pretty sure unraveling the whole deal will just have to come after we get her… you.” Lovísa frowned. “But that’s so messy. How will I know where in time we’re at?” “Use your watch.” “But it takes so long to sync,” Lovísa protested, “I don’t want to do this,” she whined. “Not this way,” she clarified. Marcus and his two bodyguards all yawned in unison. “Takes a couple minutes. But you have to understand… there’s obviously no other way about it, Lovísa. Just follow my lead, ok? It should be clear to everyone what your self is going for.” Marcus fondled the sharp division between shifted space and settled reality. His fingers vibrated, and sounded a little, like guitar strings. He tried playing a tune, but couldn’t figure out how to get any harmony out. “I can’t believe you want prison time that bad, by the way,” Marcus cracked as he stepped into the shifted space with a pop. The two bodyguards followed. “Prison?” apprehensively Lovísa thought fondling the division. “I don’t want to send myself to prison,” she muttered over the pop.
</p>
<p>“So how far are we?” “Day before yesterday.” “Sure you needed me for this?” “Look, don’t be daft Lovísa. You know what this is. You already managed to shift on us continuously. There’s going to be a dozen more corridors into delta spaces, each one slipping further, obviously. We lost a lot of time already so let’s hurry on through.“ “How far does it go?” “Destination point is now in the 1980s sometime.” “What? Where did I get the energy for that?” “You hijacked the power for the smelter there. It’s just 120 years Lovísa. Totally routine at the lab now.” “No way. Never seen a space that far.” “Ok, they’re very small. Tia demoed some just last week. She said her breakthrough–look, we need to hurry.” Marcus and his two bodyguards stepped through into two weeks ago. Lovísa’s watch chirped three times. 13:50 August 11, 2121. The space wasn’t 2 days ago. They were 15 years back already. Putting the destination space into Apollo 15’s mission space. What was Lovísa up to?
