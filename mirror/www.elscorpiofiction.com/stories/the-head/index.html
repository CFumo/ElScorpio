		<div id='text'><p><p>In the future robotics companies began producing simple, artificially intelligent pets. It started with hamster-like robots marketed toward children. Small and soft, these Hamdroids™ did not eat or shit, were physically affectionate, and, when ignored for any length of time, went into a harmless stand-by mode. They were wildly popular, and only caused trouble when real pets got sick eating them.
</p>
<p>Robodogs™ came next. Robodogs had approximate, apparent canine intelligence; were unwaveringly loyal and affectionate; and required minimal care. Models were built after every breed, and puppies were especially popular, since they didn't age. There were some attempts to start robotic dog-fighting pits, but the dogs could not be made aggressive without extensive modification—they wouldn't fight. Neither were they targets of abuse in the home. The robodogs were not programmed to "feel" or show any expressions of pain or fear. Without the cowering and whimpering, they were unfulfilling victims.
</p>
<p>It was much easier to modify their hardware than their software. There were reports of individuals augmenting the anatomy of their robots to explore their bestial tendencies. Inadvertently, the dogs' compliant personalities made them willing lovers. But more common were reports of people creating fantastic new bodies for their robots. Using the dog mind as the base, people built wild custom skins based on creatures real and imaginary. In my time I saw lions, tigers, miniature elephants, many-winged horses and three-headed beasts as gentle as Labrador retrievers. The creativity and skill involved in their creation was inspiring.
</p>
<p>Some people also transplanted their dogs into human skins. Most of these skins were beautiful, curvaceous women, and your imagination can take it from there. Sex-bots already existed at that time, but their programming was rudimentary, and their behavior left something to be desired. The AI used in the dogbots was simply top-of-the-line.
</p>
<p>These kinds of rumors made people uncomfortable, but they didn't push any boundaries, until this: A woman in Arizona peeped into the yard of her neighbor—registered sex offender Manuel Ortiz—and saw him with a naked child. But when the police arrived they had no grounds for arrest. It was only his robotic dog, wearing the custom skin of a little girl.
</p>
<p>The story broke to public outrage and a rash of televised debates. Many thought failing to prosecute gave semi-license to disgusting behavior. Some saw this reaction as inconsistent when so many had turned a blind eye on the modifications to the original dog skins. Bestiality was just as illegal as child molestation. Still others argued that this use of the robots was a safe outlet for otherwise deviant behavior.
</p>
<p>The controversial skin was built by a man named Andrew McQueen. McQueen had apparently been commissioned for many custom skins, benign or otherwise. We eventually obtained a warrant to search his house, and broke in one day while he was out. Something big lumbered toward me in the dark foyer. About horse-sized, it was apparently a classically-shaped green dragon, but with the head of a woman. The face was blank, expressionless, but its scaly tail wagged back and forth, and it nudged its head against my knee, and I realized it was only another dog. Recovering from my fright, I gingerly patted its soft head. Surprising, my desire to indulge it, despite its chimeric grotesqueness, and even though I knew it only expressed a facsimile of emotion. A dog is a dog after all.
</p>
<p>The garage was a maze of cluttered tables and weird machines. Among the electronics I found robot parts: a dog's leg, a blue human hand, the head of a pig with little horns. But I also found pieces that seems to be arms or limbs from a creature I couldn't name; bulbous heads and weird long bodies modeled after no real animal. These fragmented simulacra made me distinctly uneasy.
</p>
<p>There was also the head of a human woman with no mouth, attached from the neck to a computer by a series of tubes and wires. I saw with disgust that it was awake, and followed me with its eyes as I moved around the room. Nearby was a large wooden box which drew my attention. As my fingers touched the lid, the head behind me began to scream, only since there was no mouth it sounded muffled and distorted, like someone had clamped a hand over its face. I've seen a lot of gruesome things, and I can usually keep a level head. But in a panic of revulsion I fired fifteen rounds into its head and neck until it stopped screaming.
