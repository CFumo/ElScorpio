		<div id='text'><p><p>"I don't know. I still think it's a bad idea."
</p>
<p>"Hah, come on! Don't you think I-"
</p>
<p>"...But what if something goes wrong? What if there's something you didn't account for?"
</p>
<p>"I know bu-"
</p>
<p>"...But what if you did everything right but circumstances out of your control cause an accident? Can you even imagine how terrible the consequences could be?"
</p>
<p>"Look, all I'm tryin-"
</p>
<p>"I KNOW you've double checked all the math and all the wiring and the breakers and the seals and whatever those crystal things were called and you've done all the dry runs and you wouldn't do it if you weren't confident but I'm just..  worried."
</p>
<p>"Listen. I appreciate your concern. And.. and I want you to understand that I love you and I don't want to do anything that you aren't comfortable with. But-"
</p>
<p>"But what? How are you possibly going to justify this after saying something like that?"
</p>
<p>"...BUT I really feel like I have to do this. Not for the sake of our relationship because obviously it's not helping but for everyone. For the whole world. I mean it! Oh don't look at me like that. What if I'm the ONLY person who will ever have this opportunity? What if this is a historic moment? Maybe one day people will be reading about this event in their history books and marveling at how close we came to missing out on this kind of knowledge. It'd be such a tragedy to find out that-"
</p>
<p>"I think this whole stupid thing has given you a god complex and you're too proud to admit that you might be wrong."
</p>
<p>"But don't you agree? If I don't do this who will? And think about what we stand to gain for once. I honestly think it's worth risking my life for that knowledge."
</p>
<p>"But what about paradoxes?"
</p>
<p>"What about them? We don't even know if they exist. Why does everybody always assume the worst? How could the universe exist for this long if paradoxes-"
</p>
<p>"Throwing away YOUR life for this is one thing. Possibly throwing away all of reality is totally different."
</p>
<p>"I KNOW that. I just have a strong feeling that paradoxes aren't real. Oh my god stop looking at me like I'm an idiot. I know what that sounds like. But this is my job. I've been theorizing about this stuff all my life. And that theory was built up from other theories that a lot of really smart people spent a lot of time on. I’m not just making this stuff up.”
</p>
<p>“Oh come on. You of all people should know how big of a difference there is between proving something like this theoretically and actually doing it. Weren’t the tests enough? Can’t you be happy knowing that this is possible? That this thing works at all?”
</p>
<p>"Look, I know this is scary for you. It's scary for me too-"
</p>
<p>"Oh don't patronize me. I AM scared because you're about to possibly kill yourself in the name of science-"
</p>
<p>"EXACTLY. Exactly! In the name of science. So many life changing discoveries have been made by researchers putting their lives on the line like this. It's true, I don't exactly know what's going to happen. I'm afraid of dying. But I'm confident that my math is correct and that the theory is sound. I want to do this. I want to prove that it can be don-."
</p>
<p>"..I can’t believe we’re actually having this argument. This is insane. I’m going to be very clear with you; I can’t let you flip that switch. If you don’t get out of the machine right now I will pull the plug myself and call the police."
</p>
<p>"Okay FINE. Damn it. We'll just make toast the normal boring way like we always do."
