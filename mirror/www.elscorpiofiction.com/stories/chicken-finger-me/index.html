</p>
<p><em>"Chicken Finger Me." - Marcie Phillips</em>
</p>
<p><em><br></em>
</p>
<p>“Rex, goddamn it, lay down some covering fire!” Sgt. Kurtz yelled over the klaxons and ozone collapses. Rex blubbered something, in hysterical tears, and pointed the standard-issue Klopka .98 roughly in the sun’s direction. 7 seconds and 19.6 trillion pulses of neutrino radiation later, Rex’s clip went dry.
</p>
<p> “At the enemy, private!” barked Kurtz and primed a grenade.
</p>
<p> “SORRY, SIR! RELOADING, SIR! SHOOTING, SIR!” Rex’s frantic screams, followed by controlled bursts of static-inducing high-energy pulses.
</p>
<p> Sgt. Kurtz ran out from the cover of a glass crater, leapt into a scuttled shell of a Crow Personnel Dropship, and lobbed the grenade out of the CroPDrop’s burst blister windscreen. He hid behind the center console, waiting for the familiar thump in his chest from the ultra-dense shrapnel creating voids in the explosion radius.
</p>
<p> A reload pause from Rex’s position. Kurtz heard noted the silence of the field. The klaxons had stopped. So had the sounds of energy discharges, ballistic weapons, and vehicles. Save for the constant sound of Kaidran’s ever-present windstorm, it was dead silent.
</p>
<p> Rex began to scream. Sgt. Kurtz readied his Klopka .55 submachine gun and retreated to his prior position. He expected Rex to have gone through another schitzo attack- a common ailment of telekon conscripts.
</p>
<p> Unfortunately, Sgt. Kurtz soon discovered that Rex was far too conscious for his own good. A precision-fired DeMark nanoparasite had found Rex’s position thanks to the white-hot muzzle of the private’s carbine. The shot must have come from a DeMark sniper, somewhere beyond the fog of war.
</p>
<p> Rex shrieked at his commanding officer, “OH FUCK, SARGE! THEY CHICKEN FINGERED ME! THEY FUCKIN’ CHICKEN FINGERED ME!” Too true; the parasite, illegal to all armed forces except for one (DeMark, the patent-holding sovereignty-corporation), hit Rex directly in his trigger finger. It was several inches too long and covered in thick, hair and bone protrusions.
</p>
<p> “You’re gonna be ok, Rex. Just calm down and lay still,” Sgt. Kurtz lied. “I’ll give you some ultramorph and tourniquet the wound.”
</p>
<p> “THE HELL YOU ARE, SARGE! I’M NO DUMB SHIT! THE ONLY HELP IS 300 KLICKS ABOVE IN THAT CAPITAL SHIP!” Rex stumbled backwards out from behind his cover. “I’m fucked man. I’m fucked.”
</p>
<p> Rex’s now-grotesque arm started to glow and take on a texture that roughly resembled a breaded chicken strip. The soldier whimpered and dragged his noodly, overgrown appendage through the scorched earth. Kurtz hadn’t seen that kind of rapid nanoparasite growth before. DeMark must have rolled out a new update to their weapons several days ago- patch Tusdays are a bitch.
</p>
<p> Kurtz activated his static armor and went rigid as the outer layers stiffened and the inner ones filled out and compressed around his body. Rex, now more arm than man, collapsed into a pile of depleted polonium power cores. As his unprotected face melted to the ichor-green cores, the armed nanoparasite finished manufacturing the .11kT nuclear explosive from the organic matter in Rex’s body.
</p> Kurtz witnessed his last subordinate’s explosive death with resigned weariness. How would he explain how the young soldier died to Mrs Rex Holden?</p></div>
