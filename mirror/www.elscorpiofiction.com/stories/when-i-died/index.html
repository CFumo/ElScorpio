		<div id='text'><p><p>When I died, I found myself in the Platonic form of a waiting room. There was no question of what I was doing there. When you encounter the pure essence of an idea, its purpose and function are pretty obvious. So, certain of my task, I waited.
</p>
<p>Other people sat or paced about the space. Occasionally someone new would arrive from the periphery. Never did anyone speak. Never did anyone seem to feel the need. Occasionally someone would look up from their introspection and then walk through one of two doors. Other than that, everyone contented themselves with their thoughts until the waiting part was over. I didn’t know when that was to be, but I was positive I was waiting for something.
</p>
<p>I didn’t remember much about life to be honest. I had a feeling that it had been a pretty okay time, but that I hadn’t gotten quite what I was supposed to out of it. This nagged at me a little. I couldn’t say how long I had lived or who I had known, if I had loved or lost. I guess living didn’t really leave a lasting impact on me.  It was like I had been in this waiting room before. I was sure there was more involved, but the ultimate effect was more or less the same.
</p>
<p>At least I knew I had been alive. I liked that knowledge; it was comforting in a way. I think that even that vague memory was what allowed me to observe the others in the room. Though we never interacted, it was plain that some of us were noticing the other presences and some of us only sat deep in thought. Inklings of people I had met made me curious about the bodies and faces around me.  I ruminated upon the few attachments to life I could feel.
